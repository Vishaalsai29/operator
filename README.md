### üåü Empowering Consumer Protection  

**Consumer Lens** is designed to transform how consumer complaints are analyzed and understood. Leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, this application empowers stakeholders such as consumer advocates, regulatory bodies, and businesses to make **data-driven decisions** by exploring complaint trends and patterns.  

Simply upload your dataset of consumer complaints and experience a **seamless, queriable interface** that promotes **transparency**, **accountability**, and **actionable insights**.  

### üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up 

Getting started with **Consumer Lens** is straightforward! Follow these steps to set up and deploy the application:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project to your local machine.  
2. **Prepare Your Data**: Curate and clean your dataset of consumer complaints for analysis.  
3. **Deploy Models and Infrastructure**: Optionally integrate embedding and generative models and configure a vector database (e.g., Weaviate) to serve as the RAG database.  
4. **Preprocess Your Data**: Use the preprocessing pipeline to transform raw complaint data into vector-indexed chunks ready for querying.  
5. **Deploy and Launch**: Deploy the backend to handle queries and responses, and launch the frontend to provide actionable insights and an intuitive query interface to your end users.  

With these simple steps, you'll unlock the power of Complaint Compass to explore complaint trends, discover patterns, and drive meaningful decisions.
