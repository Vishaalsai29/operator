They state the following : I opened a claim on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$5800.00} XX/XX/XXXX I was issued a refund in the amount of {$290.00} and stated I did call back to dispute the whole amount of {$5800.00} and not just the {$290.00} from XX/XX/XXXX, which is on record. According to documentation I disputed the whole amount of {$5800.00} with my first phone call to TD Card Services on XX/XX/XXXX. 
TD Card Services closed the case on XX/XX/XXXX, which was after the 90 day limit. When I called they said it was a mistake and the case was re-opened. TD Card Services said I re-opened the claim when actually I did not re-open the claim, TD Card Services did as they stated to me it was due to an error on their part. 
TD Card Services again went past the 90 day limit. I received a letter ( please see attachments ) dated XX/XX/XXXX. Also please refer to Complaint ID # XXXX. 
I do believe in my opinion that because TD Card Services did not do their due-diligence and went past their deadline to recover the {$5800.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is stated in the letter addressed to me~ that they no longer have charge back rights. They are discriminating against me even though I have gone over and above of what TD Card Services has asked of me and been more then patient since XXXX regarding this dispute.

08/04/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Credit card company won't increase or decrease your credit limit,"I am a long time customer of Wells Fargo. I had a joint credit card and mortgage with them for almost 20 years. 

We paid off our mortgage earlier this year. Our joint credit card was tied to that mortgage so we made the decision to open individual credit cards. 

My husband received a credit limit of {$30000.00} at sign-up. 

I opened my new credit card shortly after he did and received a {$10000.00} credit limit. I have requested an increase twice and have been denied both times. My credit rating is higher than my husband 's, however, no one can tell me why I am declined, or why my limit is so low comparatively. 

I have spoken with Wells Fargo on 6 different occasions over the past 3 months. Yesterday, I was told by the credit underwriting department that the algorithms make these decisions and they aren't able to explain why nor are they able to bypass the decisions made. I have been told that my credit card account is too new to be considered for an increase. 

I am beyond frustrated. Wells Fargo has been dismissive of me, they close out my customer advocacy claim without even speaking to me.

09/20/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"Check was deposited in branch Monday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. I was guaranteed I would have XXXX $ on initial deposit and the vast majority two days later being XX/XX/XXXX that amount being XXXX $ of the total XXXX $ which was also guaranteed on the date XX/XX/XXXX in store. 

When I left the store I noticed the {$220.00} was actually scheduled to be deposited on the following business day after deposit being XX/XX/XXXX which prompted me to call customer service to ensure. 

Customer service told me this was the case and I would have to wait which I was okay with which was unfortunate but I understood she may have misspoke and the {$220.00} did deposit the next day. I specifically asked for a guarantee on the remaining funds being deposit on the business days that were agreed upon on the Wells Fargo branch which was guaranteed I had nothing to worry about and it would be deposited no issues. 
We got off the phone and I felt ensured I would have the money to pay all the financial obligations I had for XX/XX/XXXX including my daughters upcoming gifts and parties for their soon birthday party. 

I wake up on XXXX certain that the money would be in my account and I notice a notification on the app that my deposit had been delayed due to previous overdrafts prior to the initial check deposit money availability agreement set at the branch that they read and I assume had permission to guarantee knowing these prior instances Ive paid and been accountable for when I failed on my end. 

I was alerted the funds would be on hold until XXXX and then I would receive the morning of the day I was guaranteed the deposit of the funds ( XX/XX/XXXX ) via Wells Fargo App on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  EST ( day of large deposit and two business days later ) stating it was now on hold until XX/XX/XXXX due to repeated overdrafts over the last six months. 

The following is direct quote Wells Fargo availability of funds policy pdf found on their website directly from the Availability of Funds Policy. 
Except as otherwise explained in this paragraph, if we are not going to make all funds from your deposit available on the business day of deposit or the first business day after the day of deposit, we will notify you at the time you make your deposit. We will also tell you when the funds will be available. If your deposit is not made directly to a Wells Fargo employee, or if we decide to take this action after you have left the premises, we will mail you the notice by the first business day after we receive your deposit. 

If you need the funds from a deposit right away, you should ask us when the funds will be available. 
In addition, funds you deposit by check may be delayed for a longer period under the following circumstances : We believe a check you deposit will not be paid You deposit checks totaling more than {$5500.00} on any one day You redeposit a check that has been returned unpaid You have overdrawn your account repeatedly in the last six months There is an emergency, such as failure of computer or communications equipment We will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw funds for any of these reasons, and we will tell you when the funds will be available. The funds will generally be available no later than the seventh business day after the day of your deposit. 

Not only was I given specific guarantees from the actual teller in the branch about availability with dates of the money due to serious financial decisions relying on them following the laws and standards set forth for them, I was also given reassurance and guarantees from Wells Fargo customer service after leaving the branch and arriving home and calling to clarify issues. I was guaranteed I have nothing to worry about when specifically asking if I could get a guaranteed on the funds will be available. 

This leads me to calling Wells Fargo customer service today and then them telling me telling me theyll file an internal complaint based on my concerns and it could be two days. I just recently called and spoke with someone higher up who said due to the nature of the check the actual reason was I would have to wait for the check to expire and get a new check which has no timetable on time Ill never get back, monetary things I can lose, and family commitments I am currently fighting in other areas to find a way to make happen. All of this resulting in missing financial obligations that will permanently negatively impact me and reflect my character in the eyes of any financial based trust but also to my immediate family as I had obligations to the birthdays of my children which are less than a week away and Wells Fargo following the law and honoring their commitments or just actually trying to be proactive and fix the situation could have prevented. Now the accountability will fall onto me which Ill shoulder but I dont feel I was treated close to fairly and like it didnt seem to matter my circumstances of how much that amount of money was depended upon for my family. I dont want others to deal with the consequences of a company supposed to be trusted with your money and having that fall onto how people view their character and ability to follow up on their financial promises. 

Bottom line I feel many laws and regulations in the federal code of regulations have been blatantly and knowing violated by Wells Fargo only viewing the money being the issue and not the principle of the rules they claim to follow and what they claim to abide by in their Availability of Funds Policy. I feel it has been unrightfully pushed towards myself being at fault just as everyone around me may think but I firmly believe the treatment from Wells Fargo was unprofessional and unjust to the core principles and laws they follow. I will have to carry the consequences of them not following the bare minimum regulations and laws and regulations set for them and also regain the truth of the entities and individuals I made commitments to based upon trusting they would follow the laws and their Availability of Funds Policy standard to which they claim to follow. 

If theres anything Ive forgot I apologize and if some of this may seem upset its because of the impact not only at a financial level via serious financial commitments but commitments to my significant other and children and them questioning my character and trust in following through on my commitments. 

I honestly never expected to experience something like this but the amount may seem small but it was life saving for immediate financial situation my family is in.

So in this submission i have listed the original complaint and uploaded the original letter from Wells Fargo Mortgage... stating that an interest rate change occurred during forbearance period resulting in overpaid interest during Covid 19 deferral. My complaint below is this overpayment of interest should also apply for my other mortgage loan ( LXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) which was under Covid 19 Deferral for the same period..only difference i paid off this loan in XX/XX/2020. Here is the previous note i sent to CFPB : "" I had two Mortgages with Wells Fargo Bank. The first Mortgage ( XXXX # : XXXX ) with a principal balance of {$720000.00} was paid off on XX/XX/2020. The 2nd Mortgage ( Loan # : XXXX ) with a balance of ~ {$280000.00} is still active. During the Covid period in 2020, i took Covid-19 Deferral for both mortgages for the exact same period ( due to Covid Deferral my mortgage payments were deferred ). In 2020 i received a letter from Wells Fargo saying on my mortgage that is still active ( Loan # : XXXX ) Wells Fargo Overcharged me for Deferred Interest ( something to do with interest rate change occurrence ) and gave me a refund/interest rate adjustment of {$3900.00} and a check for {$370.00} for a total of {$4300.00}. I then contacted Wells Fargo and said this interest rate change occurrence also applied to the other mortgage which i paid off in ( Loan # XXXX ).

I wrote to Wells Fargo 3 times on this, and they have not responded. Since the mortgage is paid off they do not want to open a can of worms because if this mistake applies to all loans with Covid 19 Deferral that were paid off Wells Fargo will have a big liability on their hands.

I found that odd because I logged in 2 weeks earlier and set up the Post dated payment to pay off the balance in full on my due date. When I called in the account did not have that payment posted and the late fee was billed. I called in and paid off the balance in full ( like I have done every month since opening the card ) and asked for the late fee to be removed. The agent refused and said that a manager couldnt fix the issue either because her system determined I wasnt eligible for the removal. I informed her that I set it up online through their system and the payment didnt post so this is a bank error not mine. She said there was nothing to do. I asked for a complaint to be submitted and requested a return phone call back with the resolution. She said that department cant be reached and doesnt return phone calls.

This was a fraudulent charge and was reported to chase the next morning. Chase immediately reversed the charge and started their investigation into this. 

Upon completing their investigation, they found this charge to be valid and removed the amount of XXXX from my checking account. 

Chase told me that this debit card was added to a mobile wallet a few months back before the charge has been made and assumed that it was a legit charge. But I do not use any virtual/mobile wallets.

I have never used a debit card to make any online payments.This debit card was not saved to any online website or even had the details entered online anywhere. I only used this card 3-5 times to withdraw small amounts of cash from only Chase ATMs inside of the Chase bank. It never left the home other than those few times. I do not keep a debit card in my wallet on me.

I have not added this debit card in any mobile/virtual wallet as I do not use Debit card at all. 
Chase is unable to give me details of when this card was added to a mobile wallet or who added it. Since I do not have my own amazon prime, there are no records of this to prove that I did not make the charge. Amazon does not recognize the charge as they would need an account to pull up this information.

I have always been a law-abiding citizen and have never been involved in any illegal or criminal activities. However, my bank account was frozen without any warning or explanation, leaving me unable to access my funds or pay my bills. This has caused significant stress and anxiety, and I am deeply worried about the impact this will have on my financial stability and well-being. 
I understand that there may have been a legal reason for my account to be frozen, but I believe that this action was taken without due process and without adequate communication. I have not been given a clear explanation of why my account was frozen, nor have I been given an opportunity to contest the decision. 
It is unacceptable for innocent individuals to be subject to unjustified freezes of their bank accounts without any explanation or justification. 
Enclosed a statement from chase showing my bank information and the balance which I cant have access to it. 
I would appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter as soon as possible. Thank you for your attention to this important issue, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

On XX/XX/XXXX, when I logged into my account, I noticed I had been rebilled for the disputed amount ( with no communication from Chase ). I appealed the dispute findings, and spent more than 10-15 hours on hold and on the phone with Chase over the next couple of months, only to eventually learn that my appeal was never considered, because it was past the deadline to appeal the decision. However, the dispute was decided after this deadline, and I never was told this in all of the time I spent on the phone with them, or communicated in any other way. 

I got connected to their executive team, and basically have lived through this process again over the past couple of months, with terrible communication, failed promises to call me back ( even after a message sent through a colleague was acknowledged that Id cleared my schedule for the full day ), and it is just absolutely unacceptable how they have handled my problem and their disregard for me receiving more than {$10000.00} in services I did not receive.

Despite clear evidence of fabricated documentation and serious misrepresentations by the merchant, Visa overturned a previously resolved dispute in my favor, resulting in significant financial harm and emotional distress. 

Summary of the Complaint : Acceptance of Fabricated Documentation : Visa accepted documentation from the merchant that was clearly erroneous and unrelated to my transaction. The documents included another individuals name and address, incorrect service dates, and a forged signature. This should have been identified as fabricated during Visas review process, yet it was inexplicably accepted as valid. 
Misrepresentation by the Merchant : The merchant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, misrepresented themselves as a moving company when they were actually operating as a broker. This crucial information was never disclosed to me, leading to a significant misunderstanding of the services I was engaging in. Visas acceptance of their documentation allowed this misrepresentation to go unaddressed.

Unjustified and Inflated Charges : I was provided with an initial estimate by the merchant, which was later doubled without any justification. Despite providing evidence of this price gouging, Visa still sided with the merchant, demonstrating a lack of thorough investigation and disregard for fair consumer treatment. 
Overcharging for Supplies : I was overcharged for moving supplies that were either not used or incorrectly categorized, leading to inflated costs. Visas review process did not properly address this, further exacerbating the financial harm I suffered.

Failure to Provide Agreed Services and Missing Items : The merchant failed to provide the agreed services, including unpacking at the destination, and several valuable items were missing upon delivery. Despite providing detailed evidence of these failures, Visa ignored these issues, leading to an unjust decision against me.

Impact on Me : Visas acceptance of fabricated documentation and their failure to properly investigate this dispute have caused me significant financial loss and emotional distress. This experience has severely undermined my trust in Visas ability to protect consumers from fraudulent practices. 
Requested Resolution : I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly. I seek a re-evaluation of my dispute, expecting that Visa will correct

its mistake and refund the disputed amount. I also request that the CFPB ensure Visa implements more rigorous review processes to prevent such failures in the future.

I am prepared to provide any additional information or documentation the CFPB may require to support this complaint. 

Thank you for your attention to this serious matter.

Yesterday, I called the credit card company ( XXXX XXXX ), and at least twice when I asked over the phone "" Is this ~ {$XXXX} in credit spendable. ( I asked this because I JUST exited my hotel room at The XXXX @ XXXX, and the purchase was at least {$XXXX}. 

They again confirmed and that charge WAS pending on my credit card balance of credit availability. 

So, XXXX I spent some money on a suit and some jewelry thinking I have the credit to do so... 

This morning, I woke up and checked my accounts ; {$XXXX} credit limit, and I had not spend more than {$XXXX} XXXX. I called both The XXXX and XXXX XXXX and even though I was in a banking career for XXXX, and have had active checking for about a decade now with XXXX XXXX 

Now, due to their lack of education or technical disputes, I am $ XXXX {$XXXX} over my credit limit on that card. I could have very easily put the brakes on my spending, Yesterday, and thought I was in the clear. 

Their reconciliation process leaves much to be desired, because you don't actually know how much you have spent. 

In addition, my card has been declined before this incident, this last week, buying minor purchases ( coffee, water, XXXX XXXX ). 

About a month ago, XXXX XXXX neglected to tell me via any method of contact about the interest accural on my XXXX  card ( for cash advances ) was daily... not weekly or monthly. 

I have accounts elsewhere and have not had these issues with any of them upto this point. 

The XXXX @ XXXX, XXXX have not charged we at time of booking ( in which I should have had a discount given my XXXX works for XXXX ). and then the put an authorization hold on that same card for room and incidentals. 

I called them today and told me the hold release is dependent on my bank. I called the bank and they said it was The XXXX causing the problem. Paradoxically. 

So I am complaining today over XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and the XXXX @ XXXX. 

I need this to straighten out.

They should be held accountable and we should be compensated for our losses. It's about time people get credit for all that these giants take from them during hard times. They are feeding on families in there most vulnerable times. Thank you for all that you do. I hope you guys are able to keep doing what your doing. Your service to folks like myself is greatly appreciated. We need more agencies like this to fight these greedy monsters and we need permanent laws to keep them from doing it again! Hopefully one day low income families won't have to work so hard just to be stolen from by bug business. This agency is a great start. To the individuals who fight hard for consumers, Thank you!

This was in an effort to contribute to a faster pay down and lower the amount I pay overall in interest expense. However, I noticed months later that Wells Fargo was actually taking my payment and putting it as "" unapplied funds ''. If these funds are supposed to go TOWARDS my mortgage and it was clearly expressed that these should go towards my mortgage why were they holding that money until the end of the month to make a final lump payment which ultimately achieved the original 1 time payment outcome. Additionally, what is Wells Fargo doing with potentially MILLIONS of customers ' "" unapplied funds ''. I suspect in the aggregate that's a lot of money they are holding on balance sheet and potentially gaining short term interest income off of while the consumer isn't reaping any benefit.

These clauses allowed lenders to demand full repayment when a property changed hands. The Act recognized these clauses as enforceable but introduced critical exceptions for specific situations. 

One major exception involved property inheritance. When a family member inherits a property, they can continue the deceaseds mortgage payments without refinancing. This exception is vital for heirs who might not qualify for a new loan. 
Another exception concerns joint tenants. It allows property owners to add certain family members, like a spouse or child, to the property title without triggering the mortgages full repayment. 
The Act also supports estate planning. It allows property transfers into a certain type of trust without demanding loan repayment. This is crucial for managing assets and avoiding probate. Many individuals plan to avoid the complicated and public probate process through an inter vivos trust. Also called a revocable living trust, this legal tool allows for a more accessible estate administration process for your loved ones. 
In North Carolina, these provisions streamline real estate transactions involving inherited properties. They provide clarity and financial relief for families during the transfer of ownership.

My problem is due to a sXX/XX/XXXXXXXX that led to me missing time from work and paying lots of medical bills. I have been trying to work things out and get a plan to catch up but have been given the runaround by their staff. I got a letter recently that said they want me to move out and will give me {$1000.00} to do this. I feel this is outrageous! I am the owner of this home and I have the ability to pay but when I was in trouble and asked for help Vanderbilt ignored me. There was no loan modification considered, there was no forbearance there was nothing. All I was told was go ahead and pay what you can, but dont get too far behind. I did this, but now I guess I am too far behind because no one will talk to me or help me and I am locked out of my online account.

The agent at that time gave me the balance minus the late and interest fees because my initial payment was returned because the mailing address for the payment was returned because AMEX changed the mailing address without my knowledge. In XX/XX/ I called again to confirm my account was closed and the balance XXXX. I was told the account was closed but a balance of {$0.00} remained which I again paid. Despite being told the balance and paying the balance AMEX kept adding a balance fraudulently. Additionally, even though I closed the account in XX/XX/ which AMEX acknowledged on several phone calls, somehow they came up with an erroneous close date ofXX/XX/XXXX only after I filed several complaints. Amex has been fraudulently charging me late fees and interest on a closed account which I attempted to pay off the balance on two separate occasions after speaking with reps. I contend AMEX has been fraudulently continuing a balance on the account and charging late fees and interest fees and erroneously changed the closed date account only after I filed several complaints. I request for the phone calls be reviewed where I actively tried to get the balance to XXXX the account and suspiciously a balance kept appearing. I request that you remove whatever balance is on the account and to report my account to the reporting agencies as in good standing considering I have spoken with AMEX agents on more than one occasion trying to pay off the balance in full. I should not be charged late and interest fees on an account I attempted to pay off on more than one occasion and after I closed the account in XX/XX/. The agent said they would credit the account the late and interest fees in XX/XX/ when I paid off the balance and closed the account. All other late and interest fees after XXXX are fraudulent as the balance should have been XXXX. My account was in great standing for years, it has only been since I have tried to pay off the balance and close the account that AMEX has been fraudulently overcharging me on late and interest fees and perhaps intentionally giving me incorrect payoff amounts so a balance would remain.

The check was paid by my bank the next day, XX/XX/XXXX, Monday. Wells Fargo put a hold on the check stating that my signature was incorrect and suggesting to their customer that I cancel the check and reissue it. 

The hold was for XXXX  days ( until XX/XX/XXXX ). For the next ten days, the reps at Wells continued to tell their customer that my signature was wrong and that was the reason for the hold. Each time their customer came back to me asking me to re-write the check, I had to tell him that the check was paid and Wells had my money. 

This resulted in confusion as the Wells customer wanted to believe what his bank was telling him. When he showed the reps at Wells a copy of the canceled check, they took a belligerent tone with him. 

I've complained to the XXXX, FDIC, and NC DOJ. The latter two agencies referred my complaint to the Comptroller in XXXX. All agencies with the exception of the XXXX claimed confidentially issues barred them from addressing my complaint. 

My concern is that non-English speakers ( and possibly others ) are being targeted with excessive check-holding practices, citing false reasons. My understanding is that every bank has a right to hold checks for any number of reasons. My problem is that Wells used me to lie to its customer. If they are doing this to others it is causing a headache for many. The payoff is that they earn pennies to the dollar in interest on every cashed and held check. 

The reps at Wells Fargo will cite confidentiality reasons when they view my complaint. And that is understood.

The account in question has been reported as past due on my personal credit report, causing my credit scores to drop by XXXX points. This has made me ineligible for a mortgage, which has significantly impacted my personal and professional life. 

To provide context, I first contacted Chase Bank in XX/XX/XXXX to explain that I was unable to make a payment on my business credit card account because our vendor had not paid us. I made it clear that we would make the payment as soon as we received the funds from the vendor. However, despite this communication, the account was reported as past due on my credit report.

However, the representative did not explain the terms and conditions of the account, which stated that the account would be reported as past due on my personal credit report. If I had known this, I would have made a payment in XX/XX/XXXX to prevent the negative reporting. 

I understand that it is my responsibility to make timely payments on my accounts, but in this case, the negative reporting was due to circumstances beyond my control.

I request that Chase Bank remove the negative reporting from my personal credit report, and take any other necessary actions to correct the situation.

I contacted XXXX Credit Card company late XXXX for financial assistance as I could not get my feet back on the ground once returning to work. I originally was told I qualified for credit protection, that I have been paying for the entire time I had this card. I did exactly what they told me to do supplied with a note from my doctor. I did not hear back for over 30 days ( the time told it may take to process ). When I reached back out I was told by a supervisor I was declined from the program as it turns out I did not meet the requirements for credit protection like they originally thought. Because I was not out of work for XXXX days or more, it was only XXXX days, they declined the protection. Keeping in mind I only signed up for credit protection as my chronic documented medical illness was supposed to be covered by their protection provided I have doctors notes of being under a doctor 's care for a significant amount of time ( as it is in all my other credit cards too, suffering from illness for XXXX years now so I am always sure to check this ). The supervisor was extremely rude saying if I was sick for longer I would qualify but I was about XXXX week short of that. He said I could do the re-age program and sent me over to sign up for that.

I have made XXXX of the XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) and got a notice of my account still being past due ( today XX/XX/XXXX ). I contacted the company to which I was told the re-age program does NOT bring accounts current until AFTER the payments are made, thus my credit will be hit when the XXXX days ( month XXXX ) of the program ends. I would never have signed up for this program if it was going to affect my credit, I would have worked to try to find other arrangements to make my account current. Now, we are months into trying to get assistance to no avail all while my credit is taking massive hits.

Found out while loading applications on to a new phone and signed into the app. Otherwise would have never known. I tried to pay the bill completely off immediately upon discovery but the only over the phone option is to give Chase your full bank account number and routing number giving them full access to your personal accounts.

Two days ago they made the decision to close my bank accounts and freeze my funds. 

On XX/XX/year> I received a requested for a wire reversal to a client who had recently made multiple purchases from my company. I responded to the bank with a detailed letter explaining why I would deny the reversal of funds. Essentially stating the client paid for items and received all items in full. The bank said they would investigate the matter and get back to me. 

In my letter I detailed how the client had made a few purchases of products and paid through wire transfer. After the funds were received by my company the client came into our business and received the items he ordered in full. When I received the request for wire reversal I called my client to see why the request was placed. He told me that his bank issued the request not him. As well as explaining to me that after he purchased the items from my business he then handed the products over the another individual for safekeeping. It turns out the other individual had no intention of storing the items for him and stole the items to keep for himself. He was scammed by an individual not associated with my company. Obviously we can not be held liable for a client poor decision making after our business has been completed.

08/16/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"To Whom It May Concern : I am writing to file a formal complaint against Wells Fargo regarding their inadequate handling of a credit card dispute involving an unjustified charge of {$72.00}. Despite providing ample evidence that the charge was fraudulent, Wells Fargo failed to conduct a thorough investigation and wrongfully upheld the charge, resulting in significant financial and emotional distress. 

*Background : On XX/XX/year>, I utilized XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX to send a XXXX envelope abroad. On XX/XX/year>, I noticed an unexpected charge of {$72.00} on my credit card statement. I immediately disputed the charge with Wells Fargo and provided detailed documentation supporting my claim that the charge was unjustified.

*Issues with Wells Fargo 's Investigation : 1. Acceptance of Fraudulent Documentation : Wells Fargo accepted documentation from XXXX XXXX that was clearly fraudulent. The receipt provided by XXXX XXXX in response to my dispute contained placeholders such as changeme in the address line, and both the company and tax numbers were listed as "" XXXX. '' These obvious errors should have raised serious concerns about the validity of the charge, yet Wells Fargo chose to uphold it without questioning the legitimacy of the documentation.

2. Failure to Acknowledge Merchant Admission of Error : I conducted my own investigation via online chat with XXXX XXXX Initially, they claimed that the charge was due to inaccurate dimensions or weight of the shipment. After I provided the correct information, they changed their explanation, stating the charge was related to an extended area surcharge by XXXX. I verified that this claim was false by checking the zip code on the XXXX website, which confirmed it was not classified as an extended area. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX eventually admitted that the charge was invalid and assured me that a refund would be processed. In a later communication, XXXX XXXX informed me that "" the funds should have been charged back to your account by now. If you havent received the refund yet, please check with your bank to confirm the transaction status. '' Despite this admission and assurance, I have yet to receive the refund after more than three months.

4. Wells Fargo 's Unwillingness to Redo the Investigation : Despite overwhelming evidence, including the fraudulent receipt, XXXX XXXX admission of error, and the communication indicating that a refund should have been processed, Wells Fargo has refused a thorough investigation of my case. Their response has been dismissive and fails to address the core issues I raised, further exacerbating the situation. 

*Request for Refund of Interest Charged : As a result of Wells Fargo 's failure to properly handle this dispute, I have been charged interest on this fraudulent transaction. I request that Wells Fargo not only re-open and thoroughly investigate this dispute but also credit back any interest that has accrued due to this unjustified charge. 

*Conclusion : I believe Wells Fargo has acted irresponsibly by failing to protect me from a fraudulent charge and by not performing the due diligence required in handling my dispute. Their actions have left me without a resolution and have caused unnecessary frustration and financial harm.

Once I found that out, I called Chase to reduce the transfer to {$1000.00} so I would be able to make the {$500.00} in purchases to qualify for the {$200.00} cashback offer. 
Reviewing my statement after the three months I realized that I was not credited the {$200.00} as promised. I called Chase customer service three different times. The first time, I was told that if I could provide the offer number, they would credit my account. Unfortunately, there was no offer number listed and I did not keep the application that was mailed to me after being accepted for the card. I explained about receiving the mailings promoting this offer and that the offer was still being promoted on the website for the same exact credit card. The next time I called, I was told that this offer is not available for my account. 
The next thing I did was send a secure message to Chase on XX/XX/year>. I explained that I received the offer in the mailing that was sent to me and also when I finished the application online it was clearly stated on the Chase website. I provided screenshots of the information that was promoted on the Chase website in XXXX when I applied for the card and also in XXXX, when the current promotion was still being offered. I was again told that this offer was not available for my account. No other explanation was given. I sent four different messages, XXXX on XX/XX/year>, another on XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, and the last one was XX/XX/year> of which I got no response. In all the communications I am asking why my account is not available for this offer. It is the same exact credit card that is being promoted with this {$200.00} cashback offer on {$500.00} purchases in the first three months of opening. This offer is still being promoted on the Chase website today. The only answer I received is that my account is not available for this offer. I also did research online and it seems like a lot of other people are having this problem with Chase where they are not receiving the {$200.00} cashback bonus offer that was promised. This promotion was the main reason I accepted the Chase credit card. I received many different offers from different credit card companies but decided to go with Chase because of this specific offer.",None,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NC,27217,None,Consent provided,Web,07/15/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,9514949

As I kept asking questions and not getting satisfactory answers, the Etrade rep was impatient and dismissive and actually hung up on me.

Despite multiple correspondences and complaint filings, American Express has yet to provide a satisfactory explanation or adequate documentation that justifies the reporting of the XXXX XXXX XXXX ending in XXXX as a personal liability. The responses from American Express, including the most recent dated XX/XX/year>, have failed to address my specific concerns about the absence of a personal guarantee. Notably, after XXXX XXXX initial response in XX/XX/year>, where they did not validate the account as a personal obligation, the account was removed from my personal credit report, only to resurface recently, contradicting the previous resolution. 

Additionally, this account never reported to my personal credit while it was current. It only appeared on my personal credit report after the business defaulted on the payment, which was later paid in full. The business associated with this card has fully paid the owed amount. Despite this, the account is erroneously being reported as a charge-off on my personal credit report. 

The re-emergence of this account and its incorrect status on my personal credit files is perplexing and alarming, especially since the documentation provided, including statements and a copy of the application information, does not constitute a binding personal agreement or evidence of a personal guarantee on my part. As the card was signed and used strictly in my capacity as a XXXX XXXXXXXX of XXXX XXXX, and no personal guarantee was signed, it is inappropriate and erroneous to report this business debt on my personal credit files. 

Furthermore, American Express has failed to validate this account properly, violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) multiple times.

I received another interest fee, due to the standing cash advance, which they waived again, and then I immediately paid of my whole statement in full to clear both cash advance and general credit card balance. Here is the issue, there is no separate line item in my Wells Fargo mobile app for current cash advance balance. The cash advance itself looks the same as any other credit card transaction, however the interest treatment is different than a credit card transaction, since interest occurs from the date of advance instead after carrying a balance ( like a normal credit card transaction ). Luckily, I pay attention to these things and I was able to rectify my mistake which Wells Fargo did assist me with, no issues there. However, not explicitly calling out cash advance current balance nor giving an option to explicitly pay off that balance as its own separate credit type, is predatory. I am sure many consumers are paying at least 2 months of interest if not more for a cash advance balance they do not know they have, and if different transaction types carry different interest treatments, they should be separated out.

Specifically, I am concerned about their handling of my credit reporting information without providing me with a proper method to opt out, and their unauthorized sale of my credit report and personal information to a collection agency. 

Despite my repeated attempts to address this matter directly with American Express, I have not received a satisfactory resolution. Therefore, I am seeking your assistance in addressing this issue and ensuring that my consumer rights are upheld. 

My concerns are as follows : 1. Lack of Opt-Out Method : American Express never provided me with a clear method to opt out of credit reporting. As a consumer, I believe I have the right to control how my credit information is shared and used, but American Express has not honored this right. 

2. Unauthorized Sale of Credit Report : I recently discovered that American Express sold my credit report and personal information to a collection agency without my written consent. This action is not only a breach of my privacy but also a violation of consumer protection laws. 

I have documentation to support my claims, including correspondence with American Express and records of the unauthorized sale of my credit report. I would be happy to provide these documents to assist with your investigation. 

I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action against American Express for their actions. I also ask that you ensure that American Express implements measures to prevent similar violations in the future and provide me with compensation for any damages incurred. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this issue.

Firstly, I require documentation proving that I provided express written consent for TD Auto Finance to report the inquiry in question. As there is no evidence of such consent or a court order, I must assert that this inquiry lacks legitimacy and is thus subject to removal.

Per the FCRA Section 605B, a consumer reporting agency must block the reporting of any information resulting from alleged identity theft when identified by the consumer. Therefore, I am formally notifying TD Auto Finance to remove this inquiry from my file within four business days. 

Furthermore, it has come to my attention that XXXX XXXX neglected to inform me of my right to rescission, as outlined in the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), specifically Regulation Z ( 12 CFR 1026.23 ).

10/26/23,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"I have a HELOC with TD Bank that I'm looking to have paid off and closed. 

I requested information from the bank for how to get a Verification of Mortgage from TD. 

I received a response bank from their digital team with instructions. 

I followed the instructions provided and the loan processor sent in the verification request. 

The f

irst 3 requests did not get a response. The 4 request I was told, could not
be processed due to not having a specific verification form filled out. Even though the instructions provide to me by TD Bank originally stated I just needed to send them a letter. I spoke to a representative who repeatedly told me that a letter is not acceptable and that I need to have the specific form signed and resend it in to her attention and she would call if there were any problems. 

I called 2 days later after not receiving a call from the representative asking for the status of the document and was told that since my signature on the request does not match the original document from 2018 they can not process my request. 

I explained that my signature has changed since then and what can I do to get this corrected, they stated that without a signature match there was nothing I can do. 

I understand that my signature is not the same as 2018, but I still need my verification of mortgage request completed somehow. TD Bank as a company is unable to tell me what I can do to get this requested resolved. They are giving me no other option to get me verified so that this VOM can be sent. 

I have been verified by TD over the phone, through their VoicePrint service and the secure text codes, so they are able to verify who I am. 

After speaking with numerous representatives it appears that no one is able to assist. I have been told we can "" try this or try that '' but no one can tell me what needs to be done to get this processed. I've received different answers from most of the representatives I spoke to. 

The bank is causing me financial strain as I am trying to make these payments each month and the payments have increased significantly due to interest rates. 

I feel as if TD is intentionally delaying the payoff and closing of my loan so they can continue to collect the high interest payments from me and keep this loan on the books.

I simply asked questions such as "" What did American Express do with the original application I submitted if they are not going to release my credit? '' but the reps could not answer the question and ignored it. 
I asked, "" Is American Express not under Truth in Lending? '' in which they only repeated that my credit score was too low. Any representative I've spoken to so far with American Express were clearly unsuited to answer my questions.

Anything added to your report without your written consent could be considered Identity theft 15 U.S. Code 1681c2 - Block of information resulting from identity theft Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer.

If you chose to list that in your complaint YOU MUST provide the information listed above. Identity theft reports can be filed with the Federal Trade Commission on their website 15 U.S. Code 1681e - Compliance procedures ( a ) Identity and purposes of credit users Every consumer reporting agency shall maintain reasonable procedures designed to avoid violations of section 1681c of this title and to limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed under section 1681b of this title. These procedures shall require that prospective users of the information identify themselves, certify the purposes for which the information is sought, and certify that the information will be used for no other purpose. Every consumer reporting agency shall make a reasonable effort to verify the identity of a new prospective user and the uses certified by such prospective user prior to furnishing such user a consumer report. No consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report to any person if it has reasonable grounds for believing that the consumer report will not be used for a purpose listed in section 1681b of this title.

( b ) Accuracy of report Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.

By violating section 1681b for permissible purpose and 1681c for information contained in consumer reports they are also violating compliance procedures under this title. 
15 U.S. Code 1681n - Civil liability for willful noncompliance ( a ) In general Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( A ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or damages of not less than {$100.00} and not more than {$1000.00} ; or ( B ) in the case of liability of a natural person for obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose, actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or {$1000.00}, whichever is greater ; If you can prove they wilfully violated the act you are entitled to at least XXXX $ per violation plus any other damages you have sustained as a result of their failure to follow the law. If you have to file more than 1 complaint, wilful noncompliance can easily be proven as they had a full understanding of the violations after you complained the 1st time. 

Every company in their agreements with consumers said they would follow the law and agreed to do so.They are aware that they are breaking the law. 
15 U.S. Code 1681o - Civil liability for negligent noncompliance In general Any person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( 1 ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure Negligent noncompliance means the law was violated not on purpose but just due to a lack of knowledge on the required reporting procedures.

15 U.S. Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ( 1 ) Prohibition ( A ) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.

( B ) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate.

Once you notify the consumer agencies that there is inaccurate information they must immediately stop reporting that information until they can prove that it is valid.

Those are a few violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act that you can use in your complaint against not only the reporting agencies but the furnisher of that information to them.

Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S. Code 552a ) Important Definitions ( 4 ) the term record means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, his education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print or a photograph ; This includes consumer reports ( b ) Conditions of Disclosure.No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, unless disclosure of the record would be ( 12 ) to a consumer reporting agency in accordance with section 3711 ( e ) of title 31.

04/19/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Hello- I am filing a complaint against Wells Fargo online services. I live in NC and my mother lives in AL. I am the go to person for all of my mother 's accounts- whether it's banking, doctors, life insurance - I manage all of her finances. She has been missing payments a few times, but I always manager to help her get it paid- though she was making late payment too. My mother has XXXX 's - so sometimes she forgets to make payments. And that's where I come in at. So instead of trying to get to Wells Fargo bank, I tried to set up her account online to pay from my home for her. I attempted to go to Wells Fargo in NC ( near me ) to see if I can get this online service set up. They tried to help me but they could not get the issue resolved for me because Wells Fargo online services does not have a copy of my POA. I tried to get the issue resolved over the phone multiple times, but Wells Fargo customer service reps were very nasty. I was told they couldn't do anything for me because they don't have access to my POA. I've asked multiple times to fax it over to them. When I call they will not help me because they are saying they don't have my documents from Wells Fargo Mortgage. Wells Fargo Mortgage conferenced me in with them to let them know that my documents are with Wells Fargo Mortgage. But the online service staff still did not want to help because they couldn't see it on their system. This is ridiculous. I need to have access to the online service to pay my mother 's mortgage on time. I talked to at least 7 people in the online service IT dept. The 1st level, the 2nd level ( who was very nasty ) ... the next level hung up on me. Everyone that answered to this phone number, XXXX, I had issues with - over and over. I finally went to XXXX, AL to take my mother to the bank. One of the bankers named XXXX XXXX- was very helpful to try to get the account set up online. But again, I tried to get access and the system denied me from setting up the online account. Between the Wells Fargo bank in NC and the Wells Fargo bank in AL- neither of them could help me gain online access. But the IT people from the online service, probably could have helped but they keep saying they don't see any of my documents to grant me access. So, where do we go from here? I would really appreciate if I could get this resolved, so I can get online access to my mother 's account. I also have a mortgage account with Wells Fargo, but my main interest is getting online access for my mother 's account.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NC,278XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/20/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6861267
02/23/24,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,I received a equity loan from this bank and the other name banks prior to Well Fargo. The Equity loan was approved in XXXX and the amount was {$37000.00} but recently I attempted to use it based on the statements I have always received and was told it was reduced to {$33000.00}. because of collection action or unfavorable actions not actually with Wells Fargo. I have never been late nor missed a payment on my mortgage which is now paid in full nor my equity line which is to be paid by XXXX. Even if a letter was sent the statement has always remained {$37000.00} and did not indicate this restriction.

07/28/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"On XX/XX/XXXX, my checking account was hacked. At the time, I did not know because Wells Fargo did not send a text nor call me to let me know that there was some unusual activity going on with my account. Before they were done, the hackers had moved {$36000.00} from my other accounts ( Wells Fargo Visa card, Line of Credit, and Savings ) all into my checking account. Before they moved the money, the hackers hijacked my computer with some sort of virus. I also think they had access to my cell phone #. Because when I called "" XXXX XXXX XXXX' for help. I did not know I was talking to the hackers. Unfortunately, they convinced me that the {$10000.00} that was showing up in my checking account was not mine and belonged to another persons "" XXXX '' account and that it was a crime to keep the money and the only way to get out of this was to return the money to that person 's XXXX account. So, still thinking I am talking with XXXX XXXX the person convinced me to withdraw the {$10000.00} from my bank and wire it back to them so they could return it to the rightful owner. I fell for the scam. I finally realized I was being scammed when I later saw another {$15000.00} in my checking account ( I am still on the phone with the hackers ). The hackers then asked me to send them that {$15000.00} that had just showed up in my checking account. I still did not realize that the money was in fact from my other accounts but I knew it was a scam when they asked me to go to a different branch and withdraw the {$15000.00}. I refused. The person became angry and stated they were going to turn me in to the police. After calling Wells Fargo, they froze my accounts and issued new account # 's and started their investigation. At the end of their investigation, they stated they had returned {$26000.00} of the disputed {$36000.00} to my accounts. The remaining {$10000.00} they could not return because I authorized the transaction. They also returned {$300.00} in fees and interest the hackers created. They have not returned an additional {$510.00} in fees and interest. When I ask why, I did not get an answer that made sense. One customer service rep says it would be returned with a couple of days. Another says it will take up to 3 months. On XX/XX/XXXX I checked my Wells Fargo Visa Credit card ( they placed the {$10000.00} I mistakenly gave to the hackers in this account ) and I saw that they had made an adjustment and gave me a credit for the entire {$10000.00}. Of course, I was a happy person. Unfortunately, the very next day they made another adjustment and said I again owed {$10000.00}. Which in my mind was a cruel gesture on their part. When I asked why this happened they would neither answer my question nor let me speak with anyone who was actually connected with me claim. I understand not wanting to credit me the entire {$10000.00}. However, I believe that Wells Fargo could have done some things on their end to help me the consumer ( again text or a phone call call about unusual activity ) and give me credit for part of the {$10000.00}. I also believe it should not be that difficult to quickly return to me the {$510.00} of fees and interest.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NC,28104,None,Consent provided,Web,07/28/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,9636980

So far, every month, the autodraft has not included the extra {$100.00}. Even so, the principal balance should not be going up while we are making payments on it. 

The autodraft went through on XX/XX/XXXX. I have included a screenshot of our checking account activity for that week. In it, you can clearly see a payment of {$690.00}. At the end of XXXX ( I believe it was the XXXX ), I noticed that our loan account was flagged as 19 days delinquent. Our statement ( XXXX nonsense round XXXX ) showed a number of payments and reversals that are in no way reflected in our checking account. We called Wells Fargo, and were told that they could see the error, and would investigate. They expected it to take 5 business days, and we would receive something in the mail. We never received any mail. 

The autodraft for XXXX did not go through on the XXXX. We called on the XXXX, and were told that it was because the system erroneously believed we had made extra payments in XXXX, and had no balance due. I specifically asked if I should make a payment, and was told not to by a Wells Fargo employee. We were told that she was opening a second investigation into our account, which would take 5 business days. 

On the XXXX, our account was again flagged as delinquent. We called Wells Fargo and made a payment over the phone, and were again told that our account was being investigated to see why this was happening. 

Today, on the XXXX, our loan account shows an increasing number of fake transactions on the XXXX ( XXXX nonsense round XXXX ). Again, none of these transactions are in any way reflected in our checking account. This appears to be a system error entirely on the loan account. 

Adding insult to injury, I am including our statements from XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, as well as a screenshot from our loan account page. The principle balance in XX/XX/XXXX was {$22000.00}. As of this morning, it is {$23000.00}.

My account has existed for more than 30 days, so it is not a new account. Nor was this a large deposit, as the aggregate check deposit for the entire day was less than {$5500.00}. My account has never been overdrawn at any bank, and I do not have any outstanding liabilities to Chase. None of the checks were redeposited, and no emergency conditions appear to have existed. 

The only remaining exception would require that Chase have relied on the "" existence of facts that would cause a well-grounded belief in the mind of a reasonable person '' that the check would be returned unpaid by the drawer 's bank. Upon information and belief, the drawer of the {$2000.00} check maintains an account in good standing with the paying bank, has never overdrawn an account with any bank, and did not write a bad check. Therefore, I do not believe that Chase possessed such evidence. 

Moreover, even if an exception did apply, Chase did not specifically state which exception is used for the hold as required by regulation, nor the specific evidence used in this case to make a determination of reasonable cause to doubt collectibility, if that was the exception relied on.",None,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NC,27516,None,Consent provided,Web,06/07/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7076764

However, I received confirmation emails the 3 times I submitted payment that each payment was processed. Due to the credit company 's OWN error of having the wrong mailing address, I never received any paper notices that money was past due.

- XXXX, paid {$440.00} over the phone to bring my account to good standing so I could update my address. I was told they could reach out to the credit bureau to remove the false late payments. Customer service could not tell me why the payments were not processed, and blamed this on me. 
- XX/XX/XXXX, called to confirm the payment was processed, and was told my address was still incorrect, I owe more money, and that the company does not contact the credit bureaus.

The original debt balance was {$5600.00}. I contacted XXXX XXXX  who informed me that the debt had gone to collections and they had no further information. The paralegal at Zwicker with whom I spoke told me after I had made a couple of payments that because of COVID XXXX XXXX  ( the debtor ) was suspending payments and probably dismissing them in light of financial hardships. I was told that Zwicker would notify me when or if payments would resume. I have since moved to North Carolina. 
Approximately a year later in XXXX I was served with a notice that a judgement had been found against me. I was given no notice that this was considered and it was a complete surprise. I tried contacting Zwicker and was given a run around without any one person explaining why or how a judgement could be placed against me without any notification or offer to begin repayment. 
Since then, I had not had any further contact from Zwicker until XXXX of XXXX when I checked my bank account and found that both my savings and checking accounts had been emptied and a hold was placed on my account. I contacted my bank who notified me that Zwicker had slammed my account, garnished my monies and placed a hold on the account. They could give me no further information and told me to contact Zwicker. When I called Zwicker, they told me that it was a legal hold and that I needed to talk to my bank. They also told me that they were unable to contact me which is funny since they were easily able to access my bank records. Further, I am not in hiding and my location is easy to determine. 
My issue its that Zwicker acted unscrupulously and without warning or notification after an extended time of no action to wipe out my entire savings and checking. I was given no notice that any action would be taken and since such an extended period had gone by without any action or notification, I had forgotten about the issue and assumed that the debt had been forgiven, as many credit card debts were at the time. To restate, Zwicker had told me that XXXX XXXX  was suspending payments and might forgive the debt do to the economic hardships caused by COVID. They told me that they would contact me at a later date regarding the status of the debt, which they never did. Almost three years later, they wiped my account clean without any warning or notification and froze my accounts. Since I had several automatic payments tied to my checking account, this put me in greater jeopardy.

02/15/24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 USC 1681 section 602 ( a ) ), it is imperative to ensure that consumer reporting agencies conduct their duties with fairness, impartiality, and a profound regard for the consumer 's privacy rights. XXXX and XXXX, recognized as consumer reporting agencies, hold sensitive consumer information, and I, as the consumer, assert my right to safeguard this information, as underscored by 15 USC 6801. This statute emphasizes Congress 's intent for financial institutions, including furnishers of information to credit agencies, to uphold a commitment to customer privacy and confidentiality.

Pertinently, 15 USC 1681 section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ) stipulates that consumer reporting agencies may only furnish consumer reports under specific circumstances, explicitly when directed by the consumer in writing. I have neither provided nor consented to the furnishing of my information to XXXX, XXXX, or any financial institution. Consequently, any form of consent, whether expressed verbally, non-verbally, or implied, is hereby revoked. 

Further reinforcing my position, 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) mandates that financial institutions must inform consumers of their right to exercise nondisclosure options. This obligation has not been fulfilled by the furnisher of information to credit agencies. Additionally, 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ) strictly prohibits consumer reporting agencies from including adverse information in reports without authorization. The presence of such information on my account violates this provision, as well as 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( a ) ( 1 ), which prohibits furnishing inaccurate consumer information.

Moreover, in accordance with 15 U.S. Code 1681e, consumer reporting agencies must establish reasonable procedures to prevent violations of consumer reporting laws. XXXX and XXXX have failed to fulfill this obligation. Additionally, as outlined in 12 CFR 1016.7, consumers retain the right to opt out of reporting services at any time.

I am writing to dispute a collection entry on my credit report, which I believe is inaccurately associated with my credit history. 

I recently reviewed my credit report from the three major credit bureaus, namely XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. To my surprise, I discovered a collection account that does not belong to me. I would like to bring to your attention that this entry violates the following consumer protection laws : 1. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The FCRA mandates that credit bureaus maintain accurate and up-to-date information on consumers ' credit reports. In this case, the collection entry is erroneous and does not reflect my credit history accurately. 

2. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices. This includes reporting inaccurate information to credit bureaus, which has negatively impacted my creditworthiness. 

3. Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) : Under the FCBA, consumers have the right to dispute inaccurate charges and billing errors. The collection entry in question does not pertain to any debt that I have incurred, and therefore, it should be removed from my credit report. 

4. Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ) : The FACTA ensures that consumers have access to their credit reports and have the ability to dispute inaccurate information. I have taken the necessary steps to review my credit report and am exercising my right to dispute this collection entry. 

I request that TD Bank, as the creditor, take immediate action to investigate and rectify this error. I kindly ask that you provide me with a written response within 30 days, acknowledging the receipt of this dispute and informing me of the actions taken to resolve the matter. 

In addition, I urge TD Bank to notify the credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) of the inaccuracy and request the removal of the collection entry from my credit reports. This action is essential in ensuring the accuracy of my credit history and maintaining my financial reputation. 

Please find attached copies of supporting documents, such as credit report excerpts highlighting the erroneous collection entry, as well as any other relevant information that may assist in the investigation process. 

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Should you require any further information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me at the provided phone number or email address. 

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

05/02/23,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"I was one of the customers of Wells Fargo who was denied a XXXX modification. I have not received anything from Wells Fargo. Because I lost my home it would probably be hard for anyone to reach me. Actually, I should have been one of the first people WF reached out to because I fought hard and long to get them to correct my account with excessive fees, etc.

Immediately after my husband died, I found out that Wells Fargo messed up my loan by creating an escrow account claiming I owed money for my taxes which had been paid. Also, when I carefully audited my account I found they had added a bunch of unnecessary fees. Wells Fargo double paid the taxes on my home. I contacted each taxing authority to sort things out and get proof, which I sent to Wells Fargo. Even after Wells Fargo received the proof and each taxing authority REIMBURSED them, WF still did not remove or correct the error on my account.

Later I applied for a HAMP modification which I was MORE than qualified/eligible to receive and was turned down more than nine ( 9 ) times. I worked with the people that were setup to help with modifications, I even paid people to modify my loan and each time I was denied. No one could understand why I wasn't getting approved. My attorney spoke with WF attorneys and WF 's attorney 's didn't understand why I wasn't being approved. Due to my persistence, at one point my account was handled by executive offices and even WF 's employees could not understand why I wasn't being approved. My home ended up in foreclosure several times and I even filed a lawsuit against Well Fargo and all their servicing companies. I wrote to Washington begging for help! After fighting to keep my home for years, I lost it in XXXX  and became XXXX. I was separated from my XXXX  and basically lived on the streets with my XXXX little dogs. By the grace of XXXX my XXXX  was able to stay with some friends of his until he graduated high school and went to college in XXXX XXXX 

I still have all of my documentation where I filed lawsuits against Wells Fargo and if you google me on line, you can find copies of it. I eventually had to give up the fight because I couldn't afford counsel, didn't have the knowledge or expertise to fight against WF 's team of lawyers and lost my home where I didn't have access to computers, printers or anything else needed to fight.

On XXXX2023 I sent the loan assumption form to my realtor who forwarded it to the buyer for signature. It was faxed to the loan assumption department at Freedom Mortgage on XXXX2023. On XXXX2023 Freedom Mortgage confirmed receipt of the document. They said the process take 45-90 days, so my realtor set a closing date based on that information. We contacted Freedom Mortgage as the date approached, and they said due to a mistake they never forwarded the assumption documents to the correct person. They again said it would be another 45-90 days for the process to be completed. My realtor updated all required documents and set another closing date based on that information. Every time we get close to closing, Freedom Mortgage claims that a document has expired, or they need something updated. Weve had to update the Agreement of Sale 4 times since the process started due to Freedom Mortgage delays. The original closing date was scheduled for XXXX2023. Due to the delays and failure to close on that date, it has cost us {$9200.00}, and every month another {$1400.00} is added to that. We own another home now, and were still paying the mortgage on this property nearly a year after initiating the sale process. The same buyer has been with us the entire time as well, they still want the property and are very motivated for this to come to an end.

I have complained to the HUD and they have been assisting, but Freedom Mortgage keeps delaying. They always need more paperwork, and during the delays other paperwork expires. We finally received a decision from their underwriting team, nearly a year after I first initiated the process with the assumption department their response is as follows : "" Unfortunately, they have denied the loan as underwriting believes intended purpose is to use property as an investment property. The current loan is an FHA loan which would require a primary occupant to be within loan type requirements and guidelines. '' This decision seems to be based on nothing, as they have no evidence of the intentions of the buyer. The buyer has moved out of their primary residence, and is living in a basement of one of their other properties, as they expected this to be finished months ago. I'm convinced that they're delaying in the hopes that I try to have a conventional sale, and they can get out of this low interest rate 30 year mortgage. The longer they delay, the more it costs me. The buyer threatened legal action, and underwriting has reopened the file, and now they are claiming that they will need a new application as they can't open applications once they've been denied. This will just cause more and more delay. I need any help I can get to have this issue resolved. Thanks!

The issue is that Chase has allowed these merchants and payments since inception of these plans and have now decided they want to change what they will allow. Giving roughly 30 days notice and forcing consumers to take action is inappropriate and unfair considering they have allowed these for years. 

Consider the situations where a consumer does not have an alternate method i.e. they do not have another credit card and/or can not get XXXX within 30 days for a myriad of reasons or the consumer does not have a debit card/account. These consumers will be forced to pay off their XXXX in full or incur huge fees from the XXXX companies. 

It's understandable why Chase does not want to allow these plans as they are direct competitors to their business but the fact that they have allowed them for years and just woke up to smell the roses is not the Consumers fault. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  What is a XXXX XXXX plan? 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX installment plans provide the ability to break up purchases into smaller payments instead of requiring customers to pay the full amount upon purchase. Some examples of external Buy Now Pay Later providers include : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX etc. 

Why Can't I use my Chase card for these? 

Buy Now Pay Later installment plans are a form of credit. Chase generally does not allow the use of your Chase credit card to pay for other credit products, and beginning XX/XX/year>, payments to external XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX plans will not be supported. 

What should I do? 
If your Chase credit card is a payment method for any reoccurring external Buy Now Pay Later installment plans, please update the payment method with your XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX provider to avoid any missed payments or late fees ( if applicable ).

09/13/24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","To whom it may concern, I have a mortgage account with Chase. I was granted to have my account be deferred with forbearance. I communicated throughout the forbearance weekly, to months with different representatives that called me. During the forbearance, inspectors came to my house, took pictures and made assessments. I did not consent or ask for my home to be inspected. Doing such act from the banks became very stressful to me and my family. I called the bank and told a representative to not send anyone to my house to take pictures and assess. After that demand, inpectors stop coming to my house. I continued to speak with representatives weekly to months about my hardship. During the first week of XX/XX/year>, I spoke with a representative and was told, in order to prevent my home from going to forclosure, a partial payment of {$5400.00} approximately or the full amount {$8300.00} approximately were to be paid before XX/XX/year>. 

On XX/XX/year>, I called in to make a partial payment in the amount of {$5400.00}, however my payment was not being accepted. It was said that a foreclosure became active. I explained what was told for me to do to prevent my account from being a threat to foreclosure. The representative was very nasty, rude and didn't handle my explanation well. I requested to speak to her manager. I was then transferred to the escalations department, in which XXXX took on my call. He stated to me, "" ... rest assured my issue will be handled and that his colleague will be written up for being nasty, rude and unprofessional to me. '' This is all happening on XX/XX/year>. I explain the issue to XXXX and it was told that the calls need listened to. I specifically asked him "" ... how long will it take to hear the conversation between me and his colleagues because I do not want any fees to occur upon XX/XX/year>. '' It was told to me that since my issue is under investigation, no fees will take place. It was said then that it will take 3-5 business days. XXXX reaches back out to me almost 2 weeks later and stated that nothing was said about partial payments or full payments being said to me in the conversation transcript. I ask if I can hear it, he said due to their policy and regulations, that I can't listen to conversation. He then gave an option to listen to a later date. Which he then said, it will take 3-5 business days. Since XX/XX/year> to late XX/XX/year>, I been getting the run around with different representatives, in different departments. After speaking back with XXXX, a resolution came into play for payment and I was transferred to a representative to make a payment. 

At the time of being transferred, funds of what was needed to pay was not fully available. This is due to my mother not being on the phone to make a payment with me at the time. It was ask, how much I was willing to pay, I said the partial payment of what was told to make, via {$5400.00}. It was accepeted and the representative stated to me that a partial payment can be made with my mother. I stressed and asked the representative numerous times, "" are you sure I can make a payment and there will be no problems when making the attempt with my mother. It was clear from the representative that I can make a partial payment and that my mother will need to be authorized by me during the call. 

When calling back to make a payment with my mother, another representative staed that I cant make a payment. Which XXXX then had to listen to the phone conversations. By then, I decided to record converaations, to show proof to all these hearsays that can't be heard on their transcripts. After telling XXXX that I have everything recorded, he then tells me that it was revealed that payment options was told to me the first week of XX/XX/year>. However, he now has to listen to the transcrip of what his colleague stated to me on the phone about granting me and my mother to make partial payment ( which takes 3-5 business days ). After listening to the conversation transcript, XXXX calls me back with news that it was said from his colleague that a partial payment can be made. 

I made a payment of {$7000.00} instead, and continue to pay up to being current with the financial help given from my mother. After payments were made, my account suppose to be current. It magically show fees in XXXX for a forclosure/bankruptcy/attorney cost - disbursement for {$30.00} An attorney/court - disbursement fee for {$900.00} ... and another attorney/court- disbursement fee for {$770.00} Whereas XXXX stated to me that no fees are to be charged ( due to my issue being underview ). He stated to me that his manager XXXX will call me 24-48 hours to resolve the issue of fees that shouldn't be on my account. However, his manager didn't call me. Another manager called instead, stated that the fees can not be taken off. 

This is where my complaint comes in. I have hours of recording to show proof of what was said to me. XXXX even admit that he stated that no fees are to be charged on to my account. However, fees are charged to my account. There was no explanation to why the fees that occurred, cant be credited back. I told the manager, I will get an attorney involved to handle this matter.

I utilized the drive through teller window to deposit my payroll check in the amount of {$870.00} On my deposit slip, I instructed the teller to deposit the full amount of the check into my Savings Account # XXXX, with {$200.00} of the check amount issued to me in cash as a withdrawal. The teller provided me with 10 bills worth {$20.00} each. Later, I received a notification that my check had been returned as unpaid due to a tear at the bottom of the check where the account and routing numbers are located. Due to this returned check, my account was debited {$870.00}. However, my account should have only been debited that entire amount if I had actually withdrawn the entire amount of the check in cash. I did not. My balance should have been brought down to {$340.00} since my account was at {$530.00} at the time of the deposit and I only withdrew {$200.00} of the returned check amount in cash. Instead, I have been told that my account has a negative balance because Wells Fargo claims that they issued me the entire check amount of {$870.00} as a cash withdrawal. 

Wells Fargo has performed an initial investigation of this matter under claim number XXXX and determined that they do not owe me any money because I received a new check from my employer for the returned check amount.

03/11/24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Fees charged,"I tried to pay my mortgage on the first of XX/XX/year>. Due to an issue on my end which i fully acknowledge, the payment did not go through. Due to a timing issue in my checking account, there were not enough funds in my account at the time that Wells Fargo tried to retrieve the funds. This is 100 % my fault and I gladly paid the insufficient funds fee my bank gave me. Between the XXXX of XXXX and the XXXX of XXXX Wells Fargo tried to retrieve the funds 3 times. All 3 times failed because of insufficient funds. I spent those two weeks thinking the payment had gone through and did not login to my bank or Wells Fargo to check. At NO POINT did Wells Fargo try to contact me to tell me there was a problem with the payment. Had they told me, i could have corrected it in less than XXXX XXXX. The last day of the month to pay my mortgage without a late fee is the XXXX. Wells Fargo sent me an email on the XXXX telling me it was late. I was not monitoring my emails and did not find out that my payment was late until they called me on the XXXX. Again, I fully acknowledge that not seeing that email on the XXXX was my fault. But by that time it was already too late to rectify the situation. 

So, my complaint is that even though Wells Fargo knew there was an issue with my payment, they did not tell me of the issue until it was too late for me to rectify it without incurring a {$50.00} late fee. My complaint is NOT that they didnt call me until the XXXX. Thats fine. My complaint is that the very first time they tried to contact me AT ALL, was the XXXX. 

Wells Fargo opened a complaint ticket for me and investigated. Their explanation is that they dont contact the user until the XXXX attempt of payment has failed. I dont know if that 3rd attempt always happens after late date but at least in this case, their policy of not contacting the user after the first two attempts has forced me into a late fee. I found this explanation to be inadequate as all it means is their policy is to withhold information until its too late.

To make matters worse, I lost my job the same month I was served with this "" lawsuit '', which is a tragic waste of taxpayer time, dollars, and has taken a significant toll on my health. 
Now, after becoming re-employed and getting one singular check, I called Zwicker ready to pay and make this go away- EVEN THOUGH they have still not validated the debt per my request.

Background : I was pre-approved for the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  credit card and opened the account on the aforementioned date. For about a month, I used the card without any issues. However, I then encountered unexpected restrictions on my account. 

Attempts to Resolve : I made at least XXXX phone calls to Wells Fargo to resolve this issue, but each time I was told to wait for further mail correspondence. Eventually, I received a letter requesting a XXXX form, which I submitted to the branch on time. 

Account XXXX : Despite submitting the required form, my account was closed a couple of weeks later. I later received a notification stating that my account was closed due to a discrepancy between the income I provided during the application and my income as reported on last year 's tax return. I would like to clarify that my reported income of approximately {$40000.00}, as evidenced by my XXXX and XXXX forms, was accurate and matches what I provided during my application.

I told her that I felt she was being rude and asked to speak to a manager. He listened but again told us that for proprietary reasons, he could not discuss the reason for denial. I thought, "" You can't be serious '' You can allow someone to take {$1400.00} out of our account, you put the money back in andXXXX months later out of the blue, remove it again?? '' On this same evening, my husband put a new card used to pay bills on his XXXX XXXX  and within XXXX seconds, someone in XXXX  used the card to purchase an XXXX.

On XXXX XXXX, we sent an appeal letter with great detail and asked Wells to thoroughly investigate the issue, as we could not afford to lose our money. We offered to have our devices checked and begged them to help us as their loyal customers. They failed us again and again and did not take the matter seriously, or investigate thoroughly, as they informed us via secret email messaging that we were denied again. How can you claim to be thorough in a three day period? The answer, You are NOT! When we received the private email we didn't open it because we were paranoid and thought it was fraud again. My husband went into our local branch to verify that the email was authentic. We called the fraud department again and they told us again that they were not able to give a reason, only to say that the transaction was approved. That is a blatant lie and could never be proven because it never happened. They would know that if they would be willing to talk to us in depth or us their "" experts '' to check our phones and devices as offered. They did not do due their due diligence and simply brushed us under the rug. The rep told my husband that we needed proof that we did not authorize or pay they money. We got a letter from XXXX ( Listed on the transaction with a foreign name ) stating that they have no record of a {$1400.00} payment or transaction for anything. We called them back stating that we had the proof, only to be told that it didn't matter and the decision stood. WHAT? Why have us jump through hoops when you had no intention to investigate the matter? We have not been treated fairly and as a matter of fact, we have been treated like we did something wrong., It was our money that was taken without permission. It was us that had to borrow from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX in order to pay the mortgage after the money was removed the second time. It's us that is asking to be treated fairly and for justice to be served. I've always heard negative things about Wells and now I personally know they are true.

I was upset and did not hide the fact, and she made it worse by putting me on hold for over 15 minutes. How unprofessional!! We want to say on record that we never gave or authorized any such transaction, never received any goods or services for such transaction,, have no idea who is behind what is obviously a fake account, never allowed anyone to have our card or given anyone permission to use our card or purchase anything.

I have had my Dillard 's American Express card since XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX I was having issues with my card. It was not lost nor stolen, just worn. I contacted Wells Fargo Customer Service to request that they send me another card. They sent me another card via XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have been using my card continuously since then. I attempted to use my card on XX/XX/XXXX to receive the double discount Dillard 's allows their associates four times a year ( employee discounts are linked to their cards which they must use in order to receive any discount ). My purchase was declined twice and I could not understand this since my balance is XXXX and I have a {$2500.00} credit line. I immediately contacted Customer Service and spoke with a very rude representative by the name of XXXX and was told that I called on XX/XX/XXXX to report my card as lost or stolen, which I did not do. She also insisted that I had to wait over a week for my new card and there is nothing she nor I could do about it and that if I want to contact my attorney that it was my chose to do so. I allowed her to know that double discount is only through Thursday XX/XX/XXXX and this was not my fault but she continued to speak to me as if I had did something wrong. I then requested that since calls are recorded for quality and training purposes that I would like to hear the call I made on XX/XX/XXXX to report my card as lost of stolen. She then placed me on hold and came back to advise that upon further investigation she found that my card was shut off on XX/XX/XXXX by Wells Fargo because the new card that they issued to me in XX/XX/XXXX should not have been sent to me overnight, and that it should have been investigated prior to issuing a new one. First of all, I never reported my card as lost or stolen in XX/XX/XXXX, I called to request a new card because the one I had was worn. Secondly, I never requested at that time that they overnight the card to me, they made that decision and only after they verified my identity. Thirdly, I have been using my card continuously since XX/XX/XXXX with no problems. I can clearly see that shutting my card off now was a matter of Wells Fargo trying to cover their buts and rectify something that should have been done seven months ago and doing so at my embarrassment and inconvenience. I was in the XXXX XXXX XXXX for many years and I am absolutely sure that this was all due to an audit although they would not tell me this.

03/05/24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Private mortgage insurance (PMI),"Last XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with my Wells Fargo Rep about removing PMI from my mortgage payment as I knew my LTV ratio was low enough to remove it. ( I'm a previous XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. ) I purchased the home on XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I received the requested form to remove the PMI, read all through the instructions and sent the signed document with a {$150.00} check to the Wells Fargo PMI Department address of the form on XX/XX/XXXX. About a month later I was told I was submitting the form too soon. The Wells Fargo employee called me and said the mortgage loan had to be over two ( 2 ) years old. I was furious as there was no where in the documentation that I received that said the mortgage had to be over two years old nor was it any part of the conversation when initial speaking with a Wells Fargo employee about this process. I felt my hands were tied and I agreed to cancel the process and my {$150.00} was returned. 

I then waited until after XX/XX/XXXX to re-submit the form andf resubmitted the form on XX/XX/XXXX with another {$150.00} check to have my PMI removed from my mortgage. Then I got super busy. It wasn't until last week that I realized I had heard nothing and the check had been cashed. 

I called Wells Fargo 's PMI Department on XXXX and after speaking with a woman who had no clue, I asked to speak to her superior. She put me on the phone to a very helpful you man who researched the situation while I was on the phone. To his and my surprise the {$150.00} check was posted to PRINCIPAL. hTere was no other record of the PMI removal request. The form I sent in in XXXX had been submitted with the form and the check stapled to the form. I was outraged. Why is Wells Fargo 's staff so incompetent. I agreed to leave the {$150.00} as a principal payment as the Wells Fargo man helping me said it would be a mess to get that reversed. 

Shortly I then received in the mail and via email all the info to start all over again. 
Please remember this has been going on since XX/XX/XXXX. It's now XX/XX/XXXX! 

I sent a letter this week, XX/XX/XXXX, explaining all of the above with another {$150.00} check and that if I did not receive a response within two weeks with a full refund of my PMI payments since XX/XX/XXXX and the removal of PMI from my mortgage payments, I would contact you. 

I do not believe that the policy of Wells Fargo is to require the mortgage holder to wait for over two years before they can apply for the removal of PMI from the mortgage because everyone I spoke with since has denied any knowledge of this policy and this requirement was no where on the initial and previous documentation I received regarding requesting this PMI removal.

Despite my efforts to resolve this matter directly with the bank, I have not received a satisfactory resolution. 

On XX/XX/2024, at approximately XXXX XXXX, I sent my son to the Wells Fargo branch located at [ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NC ] to deposit {$7100.00} in cash into my account he deposited via the ATM. The machine processed {$600.00} at a time, returning the remaining cash each time, and he continued to reinsert the funds. The machine successfully deposited a total of {$3000.00} in five increments of {$600.00} each. Additionally, it deposited {$480.00} and printed receipts for these transactions, totaling {$3400.00} deposited. 

However, when he attempted to deposit the remaining {$3600.00}, the machine accepted the cash but neither printed a receipt, returned the money, nor credited my account. We immediately reported the issue to the branchs customer service, who advised me to contact Wells Fargos customer service hotline. A temporary credit of {$3600.00} was issued to my account while the bank investigated the matter. 

Unfortunately, on XX/XX/2024, Wells Fargo reversed the temporary credit, leaving my account overdrawn and asserting that their investigation found no errors with the ATM. Despite my multiple attempts to resolve this matter directly with Wells Fargo, including speaking with their ATM service department and submitting a formal dispute, I have not been able to recover the missing {$3600.00}. 

I have enclosed copies of all relevant documentation, including ATM receipts showing the successful deposits, my bank statement reflecting the temporary credit and subsequent reversal, and records of my communications with Wells Fargo. 

I kindly request the CFPBs assistance in resolving this matter. Specifically, I am seeking a thorough review and rectification of the discrepancy, including : XXXX. A re-examination of the ATM transaction logs and cash reconciliation reports for XX/XX/2024. 
XXXX. A review of any available security footage from the ATM. 
XXXX. A detailed explanation from Wells Fargo regarding the investigation process and findings.

During the XXXX period in 2020, i took Covid-19 Deferral for both mortgages for the exact same period ( due to Covid Deferral my mortgage payments were deferred ).

I then contacted Wells Fargo and said this interest rate change occurrence also applied to the other mortgage which i paid off in ( Loan # XXXX ).

Then using the card directly, I tried to make purchase online for XXXX , then tried XXXX 's XXXX and then XXXX 's, but all declined. 

So I contacted an Amex gift card rep via photo although took a while because their automated phone prompts just kept giving useless info and then would end the call with no option to speak to rep. After the third time when I called back and selected a different reason, a Amex rep finally came on and he confirmed the card works on their end cause it showed active, but said that each merchant is not accepting and to call the merchant to ask if they can accept the card. So I did call XXXX while my cart was still waiting for payment after the initial attempt declined. The XXXX support rep entered the card on her end online to pay for the order still showing in my cart, but still was not accepted. She stated that they accepted Amex and technically it should work. So I could not finalize the purchase. 

All the online merchants I visited accepts Amex and this card should work wherever Amex is accepted. If the card can not be used, then it's the same as Amex stealing money or fraud as far as I'm concerned.

Join account under XXXX and XXXX XXXX Brokerage Account # : XXXX Under XXXX XXXX, XXXX did not open this account before. 

Dear Sir : On XXXX XXXX XXXX, without knowing the situation, My account in Wells Fargo bank was hacked by a hacker, who open a brokerage account under my name. The hacker transferred all of my savings account 's money to purchase XXXX shares until I got an insufficient funds notice from an e-mail from the bank around XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Immediately I reported to Wells Fargo Bank and told the claim department lady, that I did not open a brokerage account with Wells Fargo Bank. The existing stock share was not purchased from me and did not belong to me. The claim or brokerage account lady told me I have to make up existing insufficient debt. I did not agree to that and told them those stocks I did not own that because I had not purchased them before. Later on, my account was locked and I went to XXXX for my mother 's XXXX XXXX  and took care of her health until back time on XXXX XXXX XXXX I tried to contact the Wells Fargo claim department for details. They told me my case had been investigated and closed as shown in the letter on XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX They said all of the communication devices were identified such as IP, phone number, etc. That is why they closed my case. 
I am totally against their conclusion based on the following reasons and request your organization to investigate my case : XXXX Who set up my brokerage account with the wrong phone number connection under my brokerage account profile? 
XXXX. Over-action from either the brokerage account department or claim department without notice of my claim. They took out all of my money from my savings account to cover that insufficient debt in the brokerage account which was under my name. At this period, my account still was locked from Wells Fargo Bank. So far, I do not think I still own this brokerage account. They should not have the right to take my savings account money to cover their debt. 
XXXX. In the IP verification sheet, it was received on XX/XX/XXXX. This sheet was mailed on XX/XX/XXXX letter, there are too many wrongs such as IP address and others. 
IP address and ISP, State, City, and online Login history are wrong. I did verify with XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, my public IP is XXXX. It is not XXXX as your sheet listed in attached file XXXX Address XXXX. For the other company, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I did call the customer service department with XXXX XXXX, XXXX. She did check her company file and told me they did not have any service in my area. The other listed company XXXX XXXX XXXX uses XXXX for internet service which we did not have use XXXX  before. So far, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX was my home previous internet service company in XXXX. The current internet company is XXXX XXXX which also served us this whole year already. 
XXXX. User Agent with XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX, like XXXX. XXXX ) I n my home desktop computer, I do not have any XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as shown in your user agent. XXXX available browsers are XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
XXXX. In Wells Fargo Banks "" Righ to Documentation Package Contents '' in this sheet, see attached file XXXX XXXX. My home internet company was XXXX XXXX running from XX/XX/XXXX to current time XX/XX/XXXX. I did not change the internet provider XXXX XXXX. So the IP public address should be XXXX, and the location should be in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as shown in the "" Online Login History '' sheet, as shown as the file on XXXX XXXX I have no idea why you list so many different IP addresses with XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in different locations. 
I am not sure about the terms, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Do those terms are shown in your bank system? Once people access your system, the number shows up automatically. If that is true, that is your bank security system problem. At least the IP address and, and ISP is not from my side. Do you need to verify where it came from? 
I will continue to fight this case to recover my loss. Also, I believe bank security problems should not count as customer responsibility completely. 
Conclusion : I did request detailed device connection information from Wells Fargo Bank. There are a few points that are not right such as 1. The Brokerage profile listed the connection phone number as wrong, which I did not see before. 
XXXX. IP address XXXX is different than my computer 's public IP XXXX. 
XXXX. All list of IPSs companies, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are wrong which I did not use before. The user agent through XXXX was wrong too. I did not use the XXXX browser before. 
XXXX. The important thing is who allows people to open brokerage accounts with the wrong profile phone number under my name without my permission. Wells Fargo bank was designed to run savings and checking accounts purely without playing any brokerage accounts. 
Customers opening savings and checking accounts in Wells Fargo bank is based on trust, and believed that security protection technology should be the bank 's responsibility. There is no reason to ask customers to run security designs or set up devices for bank security systems. 
Please help me to invest this case and get back those lost money from bank. Thanks.

The person in which I was speaking to started saying that I had suspicious activity on my account and read off the charges to me. Before giving this person any information whatsoever, I went on to my account and saw both charges in which she referenced.

On XX/XX/2023, I paid {$300.00} on my water utility bill and used my Chase IHG credit card to pay {$200.00} of that ( the remaining {$100.00} paid with a debit card ), solely to avail of a Chase promotion for a {$10.00} statement credit on purchases of {$200.00} or more on several categories including utilities. However, Chase is refusing to give me the {$10.00} statement credit because XXXX XXXX, which is my water utility provider, is administered by the XXXX of XXXX and uses a government services merchant code instead of a utility company merchant code. 

I understand that Chase 's promotion fine print states that the merchant code must be a utility company merchant code. However, I believe that this requirement is unreasonable and unfair. Consumers should not be expected to know merchant codes in order to take advantage of credit card promotions. 

Merchant codes are used by credit card companies to categorize businesses and track transactions. However, consumers are not normally aware of merchant codes, and they should not be expected to know them in order to participate in promotions. From my point of view as a consumer, I was just paying my water utility bill. How was I supposed to know that my water utility provider uses a government services merchant code and not a utility merchant code? I would wager that, had I even asked the cashier at XXXX XXXX what merchant code they use for my payment transaction, she would not have had any clue. 

Water is a utility that Chase includes in its utilities category. It is therefore reasonable to expect that my water bill payment would qualify for the statement credit, even though my water utility biller happens to use a government services merchant code because it's the XXXX of XXXX. And it is unreasonable for Chase to expect me, a mere consumer, to know what merchant code my water utility biller uses. Consumers don't and shouldn't need to know merchant billing codes. 

I have contacted Chase customer service several times to try to resolve this issue, but they have been unwilling to reason over such a small amount. I am therefore requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that deceptive and misleading promotions like this do not continue. Of course, I would still like to receive the {$10.00} statement credit that I am entitled to. 

Thus, I am requesting that the CFPB take action to prevent Chase from using this type of requirement in the future. Consumers should not be misled or deceived into thinking that they are eligible for a credit card promotion when they are not, simply because they do not have access to information like merchant codes that are not normally available to consumers.

Unfortunately, I must now submit a second complaint related to Zwicker 's ( acting on behalf of XXXX ) loss of notarized legal settlement documents. This situation could potentially be a security breach and has caused delays in submitting settlement agreement documents to the XXXX XXXX XXXX to close four civil lawsuits. A settlement agreement was successfully reached, and notarized documents were duly submitted by the end of XX/XX/XXXX. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, we were notified by the XXXX XXXX Courthouse that they had not yet received the executed documents from Zwicker. Consequently, we provided them with copies of the notarized documents we had originally sent to Zwicker, accompanied by the Certified Mail receipts from the US Postal Service. The courthouse accepted these copies and added them to their records. ( Attached file : XXXX. Notarized and Mailed Settlement Agreements ; XXXX Notarized and Mailed Settlement Agreements ) In XX/XX/XXXX, we engaged with Zwicker & Associates, P.C., representing XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, to settle four civil lawsuits involving two student borrowers and two cosigners. We reached an agreement via email and promptly made the required XXXX payment through a bank wire transfer to XXXX XXXX. The physical settlement documents, received by mail, were signed, notarized, and returned to Zwicker within the same month. ( Attached files : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) However, complications arose in XXXX when we inquired about the closure of the civil lawsuit cases. Our attorney informed us that Zwicker ( representing XXXX XXXX XXXX ) was unable to proceed with closing the case with the XXXX XXXX XXXX, claiming we had submitted incorrect documents. Specifically, they insisted on cosigner signatures being notarized, despite the fact that we had duly signed and notarized the documents as initially provided by XXXX/Zwicker. We informed Zwicker that we couldn't notarize the cosigners ' signatures because the form did not allow for it. We requested corrected documents from them. In XXXX, they sent us a second set of documents, which were found to have missing account numbers and misaligned borrower and cosigner details. These issues were promptly communicated to our attorney, who conveyed them to Zwicker. ( Attached File : XXXX. Second Set of Settlement Files Sent by Zwicker ) Attached is an email chain from XX/XX/XXXX, involving myself, our attorney, and Zwicker 's attorney. The correspondence clarifies the misunderstanding about the XXXX documents and Zwicker 's decision to accept the originally executed documents for submission to the court, with no further action required on our part. This email serves as verification of Zwicker 's receipt of the first set of notarized documents since it was pointed out that the cosigner 's notarizations were missing. ( Attached File : XXXX. Zwicker Accepts Originally Executed Settlement ) We followed up with our attorney on XX/XX/XXXX, to check if the XXXX XXXX XXXX had received the notarized documents. Our attorney informed us that Zwicker claimed not to have received our documents and wanted us to resend them. This was concerning for several reasons. Firstly, Zwicker had misplaced documents containing financial and private information for four individuals, potentially compromising security. Secondly, XXXX/Zwicker could negatively impact our credit and reputation through civil suits. However, the inefficiency and disregard displayed in this process were deeply concerning. Lastly, resending personal and private information to a firm that had lost it once raised security concerns. ( Attached File : XXXX. Zwicker Lost Financial Documents Email ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX "" Consumer Advocate '' from the Executive Office of Customer Advocacy, who responded to our previous complaint regarding inaccurate information to the credit bureaus that was submitted to the CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX. We sought her assistance in expediting the resolution of delivering our settlement documents to the County Courthouse to avoid further complications with Zwicker. As of this complaint 's submission, I have not received a response to my email. ( Attached File : XXXX. Email to XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ) Additionally, I want to highlight a previous issue raised in the XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  CFPB submission concerning NC arbitration. The arbitration for the civil lawsuit, XXXX XXXX XXXX, was allowed to proceed despite having an agreed-upon settlement already in place. I attached the email correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX, with the NC Arbitrations Office, where I explained that arbitration was unnecessary given our ongoing settlement discussions. The NC Arbitration representative stated that she would need a letter from XXXX attorney stating this fact. Despite ample time, Zwicker failed to submit the required letter to the NC Arbitration representative. A settlement was agreed upon on XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached files XXXX XXXX ), but the NC Arbitrations Office never received this letter since we received another letter from that office stating that the arbitration had taken place on XX/XX/XXXX, more than one month later. This arbitration process proved to be a misuse of the court 's resources and likely resulted in unnecessary payments to the individuals involved. I am highlighting this issue once again because it may lend some reason to the delay in delivering the required settlement documents to the NC Courts. ( Attached Files : XXXX.

08/30/24,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue with the loan closing,"XX/XX/year> XXXX, and XXXX of Wells Fargo, Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to present my case today. I stand before you to address a series of actions and decisions by Wells Fargo that I believe have been grossly mishandled, resulting in an unjust denial of my claim for wrongful Foreclosure as my loan modification had been approved and finalized however, they proceeded to foreclose anyway, and for obstruction of my right to a fair mediation process. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Wells Fargo with a check for {$1000.00} stating there had been an error on my loan modification that had been approved and finalized. I proceeded to verify the check was valid and contacted the number that was on the letter. My information was put in the system and was told I would be contacted by a case manager. 
On XX/XX/year>, I spoke with XXXX XXXX, who called and assured me that my case would be reviewed and that I would receive a response by XX/XX/year>. Despite this commitment, I never received a follow-up call. Instead, I received a letter with a Mediation claim form, which I completed and submitted via fax on XX/XX/year>, that was 14 pages of supporting documentation, including mortgage and checking account information pertinent to my dispute, in addition to this it was also mailed I the posted paid envelope provided by Wells Fargo. 
On XX/XX/year>, I was contacted by XXXX XXXX, who informed me that she had taken over my case from XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX proceeded to hastily inform me that Wells Fargo had decided to deny my claim. When I inquired about the appeal process, she curtly informed me that no such process existed and that I would receive a letter confirming the denial. XXXX XXXX did not offer any further explanation, nor did she inquire if I had any questions, which left me with significant concerns about the transparency and fairness of this process. 
Later that day, after reflecting on the conversation, I called back to verify the validity of the call and to speak directly with XXXX XXXX. I was informed by another Wells Fargo representative that XXXX XXXX was not handling my case, and that XXXX XXXX was indeed the one in charge. Upon being transferred back to XXXX XXXX, I requested to speak with either XXXX XXXX or the Program Administrator. XXXX XXXX implied that she was working within the Highest Executive Office and could not provide any further details, including the timeframe for when I would be contacted about the next steps in the mediation process. 
I pressed for more information about the mediation process, but XXXX XXXX was unable to provide a clear explanation or a confirmation number for our call, which further eroded my trust in the process. Despite having submitted the Mediation claim form on XX/XX/year>, XXXX XXXX appeared unaware of this, and stated she does not know what XXXX XXXX and I had discussed, leading me to believe that there is a deliberate effort to prevent my case from being fairly heard in mediation. 
Given that the deceptive practices are continuing with Wells Fargo, throughout this process, I am now requesting that the punitive damages be increased to four times the original amount requested. This increase reflects the severity of the situation and the need for accountability in how Wells Fargo has handled my case and future cases, wanting to go through meditation. 
On XX/XX/year>XXXX XXXX I called again at XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX again to verify if my mediation form had been received and processed. I also asked to speak with XXXX XXXX and was told she know longer works in the department for Wells Fargo. XXXX stated that she did not know anything about meditation, and her boss had instructed her to call me and give me the results of XXXX XXXX findings and could not verify if my mediation form had been processed or received. XXXX XXXX also stated that she had to open a new case for me, and she knew nothing about the mediation process. I pressed her on why a new case has to be open. She stated that when XXXX XXXX finished her findings the case was closed. Why would the case be closed when you have not come to a resolve with the customer or to see if they wanted to go to mediation? She stated that my case had to be reopened and I will be hearing from someone from Wells Fargo within 24 to 48 hours. She still could not verify if my meditation form had been reached by the Mediation Program Administrator. 
Furthermore, I formally request that all calls related to this matter be pulled and reviewed, along with the notes on this case, as evidence of my conversations throughout this process. These recordings will clearly demonstrate the mishandling and lack of transparency that I have experienced. 
I respectfully ask that this mediation of my mortgage case proceed with full transparency and that my concerns regarding the handling of my case be addressed. I seek a fair resolution and an opportunity to present the facts of my case in a manner that allows for a just outcome. 

1. Did not offer Due Process of Mediation and stated there is no appeals process available.

2. Implied that she was in the Program Administrator Office ; by stating she was with the Highest Executive Office at Wells Fargo.

3. Did not offer any direction or timing of the next steps in the mediation process.

4. Was not able to give me an appointment, date or time for mediation 5. Had to ask what the timeframe for medication and getting an appointment she then started with the next 24 to 48 hours.

6. State someone would call me from Wells Fargo in the 24 to 48 hours but still no information on meditation.

09/05/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"On XX/XX/year> I submitted a complaint to the CFPB regarding the revocation of a 0 % APR offer from American Express without appropriate notice. Below are the details of my complaint : "" My Amex Business Blue Card, ending in XXXX, had an active 0 % APR offer. Unexpectedly, the offer was revoked when my auto-pay attempted to draft payment from a closed account. The credit card AND payment account were BOTH OWNED BY AMEX, and alternative payment accounts were already connected and authorized. I assumed the system would remove the closed account, considering the company was aware of its status. This situation caused numerous financial disruptions, but I trust Amex will rectify it. The company did not notify me of the change in offer status before the end of my billing cycle, triggering a penalty APR and interest charge. The company claims theyre not obligated to inform customers, which I find surprising as a loyal 9-year customer with 10 of their credit/lending products. However, they DID notify me when the intro APR term ended on a previous card with an identical offer, so I reasonably expected the same communication. I would have paid the entire balance and avoided the interest charges if I had been notified. Given this additional context of historical precedent, the company 's failure to notify appears opportunistic and malicious. I contacted a support agent via the online chat, who denied my interest waiver request. I then worked with a subsequent agent to close all of my credit cards, business checking, and Business Line of Credit. This agent suggested I reconnect with a support agent to find an alternative solution "" based on my account status and membership. '' So, I did. It turns out that the second agent grossly overestimated American Expresss loyalty because subsequent agents could not have cared less about my membership history. No one attempted an alternative solution, and every agent I spoke with tried to end the chat quickly. This isnt the level of customer service I expected when opening three platinum credit card accounts. I expect the intro offer to be reinstated and the interest charge refunded. '' American Express stated in their response "" We notify you when the 0 % APR offer is ended so that you can make the payments in full to avoid getting charged with late fee, interest charges. We notify you through monthly billing statement when the 0 % APR offer is revoked. '' This information is patently false. I received no notification about the 0 % APR offer and/or revocation. Based on their response, it's clear they only sent a notice relating to the returned payment. I was unaware of the change until I contacted the company. Even if they had provided notice ( which they did not ), it would not be possible to avoid the late fee and interest charges ( as the company stated ) if the notice is provided in the proceeding billing statement. 

In summary, American Express did not take the actions described in their response to my complaint to inform me of the change in APR. More broadly, the policy American Express describes in their response ( which they did not follow in my situation ) is unfair to consumers. The company intentionally alerts customers *after* the APR change has taken effect and the consumer has already incurred charges, which would have been otherwise avoidable.",None,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,NC,28601,None,Consent provided,Web,09/05/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10032540

06/21/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I have been a customer of Wells Fargo for 11 years and recently I started to have some issues with them. Today being the 3rd incident with them and I have had it with them and do not know what to do. 
I would take my paper checks every 2 weeks into a bank branch and they informed me one day about the mobile banking and how easy it was to use. So instead of going into the bank I figured I'd give it a try. 
I received an alert that my account was "" on hold '' after I deposited a {$1500.00} check from our family business into my personal account with Well Fargo though their mobile deposit and I apologize for not remembering the exact day but it was about 2 months ago and I kinda freaked out because I never had this happen before. They held that deposit and I sorted it out, they made a claim that their was insufficient funds from the check I was trying to deposit and that they were going to place a hold on my account for 7 days. I had to make numerous calls and go into branch locations to get it sorted out in a timely manner. 
Skip ahead anther 2 weeks and I ended up hurting my right hand which is my dominant hand. I had to go to an emergency XXXX clinic and they thought it was XXXX  so the wrapped my hand up in a half splint also known as an ulnar gutter splint in which case only my first finger and my thumb were accessible to write on my dominate hand, the remaining 3 fingers were completely covered in this splint and not accessible. I tell you that because of this next part. I went to use the Wells Fargo mobile deposit app to deposit the same amount {$1500.00} from the same account ( nothing new ) and my hand writing to sign the check was a little messed up, but honestly it looked like my signature just a little more scribbly. Instead of calling me to verify to see if it was me they decided to place another hold on my account and the {$1500.00} was not accessible. I kid you not I spoke to 5 different people over the phone and I visited 3 different branch locations in a span of 3 days to get this cleared up and the 3rd day I spoke to someone who told me to go into a branch location to "" VERIFY '' my hand was XXXX ... ... I can't make this up. I deposited the funds into my own account, using my cell phones and my account and I have to show you my hand is XXXX. Anyway, I go into the 3rd location and verify my hand is XXXX, they pulled me into I'm guessing the branch managers office ( he didn't introduce himself he just acted like it was an inconvenience for him ) and they finally released the funds into my account, just to literally take out {$1400.00} from my account like 7 days later and say the written part of the check says "" Fifteen '' but the box part of the check says {$1500.00} so they took BACK {$1400.00} and gave my {$15.00} from that check I fought so hard to prove it was me depositing that check with a messed up right hand. I literally can not make this up and as I am writing this it's just making me all the more frustrated before I tell you what happed today which was unreal. 
So toady I receive 2 emails from Wellsfargo. One at XXXX and the other at XXXX that my account has a negative balance of - {$360.00}. I am completely baffled by this. Their reason this time is "" Insufficient funds at inquiry time ''. I deposited that check again which is from the same amount {$1500.00} and the same account as mentioned above. I deposited it on Friday the XXXX at XXXX. Today is Wednesday the XXXX and is 5 days after I deposited the check which by the way shows a cleared balance that I have been using because I deposited it on Friday before XXXX. They placed another hold on my account and as we speak my account is going to remain negative - {$360.00} until XX/XX/XXXX which is 7 days negative. I am so frustrated and I don't know what to do. I called the XXXX number to see what was going on because I was in shock as to why this keeps happening and she told me there was nothing she could do for me and that I have to wait until the XXXX for my funds to show up in my account. I am so confused I really don't know what to do. Please help I have never been treated like this before by a bank and to be told one minute I have money in my account and then have it deducted out of the blue over and over again without notice is terrifying.

While I was on vacation in XXXX in XX/XX/2022, my credit card was charged for {$840.00} ( USD ). I did not make such a transaction and therefore I reported it to Wells Fargo ( the bank issuing the credit card ). 

Now it's been 6 months since the report and Wells Fargo refuses to pay me back for this fraudulent transaction on my account. In the meantime, Wells Fargo has passed me between their various departments ( dispute department, fraud department, etc. ). Finally, after 6 months, they have produced the attached receipt from the merchant. There are multiple issues with the receipt : 1. Most importantly, the signature on the receipt is forged ( it's not my signature- not even close- and I did not sign this receipt ). 
2. It is not itemized hence it does not show what was purchased. 
XXXX. It is unclear who the merchant is ( the company XXXX which appears on the receipt seems to be an online billing company not the merchant ). 

In spite of this clearly forged receipt, Wells Fargo refuses to pay me back and has told me that they will not take any further action on this case. 

I can let this go and pay the charges, however, there are perhaps thousands out there who are not as lucky as myself to be financially secure.

In the emails ( received on XXXX and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ), they clearly stated that they will refund my money in case they did not correctly identify the payment. So, I waited for many days for their refund but I did not receive any refund that they promised. 

I thought of enquiring the status of my spouses ITIN and searched for the toll-free number of the IRS. IRS department informed us that the ITIN application can not be done online and were required to go to the IRS office for the ITIN application. Further, they mentioned that the IRS would never ask for the debit/credit card details over the email.

I received a response in the mail stating that my application was denied because of a poor score, however, according to your prospectus, filed pursuant to Rule 424 ( b ) ( 5 ) with the SEC, in the annex section of that document, on pg. XXXX, the first sentence of the passage states, scores are based on independent, third-party information, the accuracy of which we can not verify. 

What other factors were used in denying me when I TENDERED A SECURITY that your company will turn into a receivable to receive payment for. 

It is unfair and deceptive to rely on information that you can not verify to determine my eligibility for American Express products, this could be construed as violations of UDAAP under federal law. To my knowledge, credit scores are used to determine the potential risks of prospective consumers, I have read and understood the concerns outlined in you guys prospectus in regards to risk and you can rest assured that my account will never be delinquent, there will never be a period of inactivity or dormancy with my charges and my account will be paid on time each and every month because I will be satisfying my obligation by tendering payment with the series of notes that American Express will issue out on the distribution date as described in your Prospectus. 

Furthermore, the taking of my application, with my personal identifiable information on its face, i.e. the social security number, and the transferring thereof to a depositor where it was pooled together with other receivables ( eligible investment ) and sold/transferred to a securitization special purpose entity ( trust ) for proceeds which is considered unjust enrichment and securities fraud on your companys behalf because I received no benefit. In addition, because you accepted my security you were supposed to be acting as POA in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit and protection of the investor. 

Fair exchange has never been robbery, quid pro quo, this was a barter transaction that took place with your company for equal value and consideration neither of which were received by me. Your company is in violation of the securities laws you agreed to follow and if I have to contact the I.R.S to inform them that I bartered to you a security and you decided not to live up to your end of the bargain by bartering back with me, I will have no choice but to notify them, which could have a damaging effect on the American Express Brand if further action is necessary. Let it be known and allow me to reiterate that the American Express Company owes me valuable consideration ( in the form of an American Express open-end Platinum credit card or its equivalent ) for the exchange of my security, which constituted a bartering transaction, that of which will be filed on a 1099B with the I.R.S if you continue to refuse to barter with me. Ill let the I.R.S handle it. There may have been some sort of misunderstanding with the terms of the contract, but let me reassure you that I intend for this arrangement to be mutually beneficial to all parties involved, including myself. However, as it stands right now, I have been held without equity and American Express Company is in violation of its bank charter, federal securities laws, and their agreements on file with the SEC because pursuant to your prospectus you told the SEC you would not trade securities on the secondary market, or maybe Im misinterpreting what was stated. Anyway, you may have many concerns none of which shall arise from doing business with me and many of which would result from your failure to compensate me for my investment into your company as a silent investor. IN THE EVENT THAT YOU DECIDE NOT TO COMPLY I WILL BE FORCED TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE OCC, THE SEC, THE CFPB AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, SEPARATELY FOR YOUR WILLFUL NONCOMPLIANCE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT. YOU HAVE 15 DAYS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THIS NOTICE TO RESPOND WITH A DECISION REGARDING THIS MATTER. 

Please tell me what are the factors that the underwriting team used to decide the application reasoning for denial. 

I gave you my social security number which gave you access to my trust. Several laws have been violated, such as 15 us code 1666b and the violation of the security exchange act of 1934.

01/09/24,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue with the loan closing,"I have been a victim of an illegal predatory loan and fraud by XXXX XXXX and Village Capital and Investment LLC. The basis for fraud are on the grounds of altering documentation to mislead the VA and myself to the benefit of the loan, steal equity, predatory lending in order to gain possession of my home for resale, and because they violated numerous regulations under REG E, RESPA, TILA, FHA, and Americans with Disabilities laws. 

On XX/XX/2023 I was contacted by phone from XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX about refinancing my home. She claimed that I had already been approved for a cash out refinance of my home and guaranteed a lower interest rate, pay off my debts saving me a substantial amount of money each month. She told me to cancel the contract I had already signed with another lender and claimed they would tell me what I wanted to hear and then at closing they would increase my interest rates, I would have a higher payment, and end up paying dramatically more over the life time of the loan. She said by this loan not only would I save money each month, I would have a higher credit score by my debts being paid off and can refinance again in XXXX  months at an even lower rate. She told me I needed to act now to lock in my interest rates before they were raised again by the federal reserve. She told me I needed to have a new appraisal done on my home and I would be reimbursed at closing for it.

The initial terms she stated I would be getting is over XXXX at closing, a refund of my escrow, a 4.75 % interest rate, paying off my current mortgage at XXXX, and eliminating around XXXX in debt and my monthly payment would only increase by a couple XXXX dollars. I explained to her that the payoffs on my credit report were not correct because of Identity Theft and fraud charges on my accounts and they were in the process of getting the new account numbers and balances transferred over and correct balances after unauthorized charges have been removed. She also said closing would take place by XXXX XXXX  as I was scheduled to go out of town to take care of my daughter  after a very XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX also at the time told me I would not have a mortgage payment for XXXX months and I didnt have to make an payments on my cards or vehicle for the month of XXXX because they were getting paid off. 
My home was appraised at XXXX. Initially I was only going to be financing XXXX. Well XXXX raised the amount to XXXX saying I requested it. Well raising the amount raised the interest rate, I was getting less money at closing, they were paying less of my debts because they didnt even bother getting the payoffs and went by my credit report which they knew was not correct, and closing costs went from XXXX to XXXX so this so called request for more money resulted in me financing more and getting back even less. At the time, I was unaware of any of this because XXXX XXXX continued misleading me and making it look like this loan was going to benefit me. The closing didnt happen by XXXX  XXXX  and I was getting phone calls from creditors wanting payments and reports made to the credit bureaus for payments being late. I was told they would submit credit supplements and the creditors knew they were getting paid off because she contacted them. That was a lie because she didnt even know who serviced my accounts and that my vehicle loan went from XXXX XXXX to XXXX despite the fact I kept telling her the information she refused to listen. 
On closing day, a notary was sent to my home. I am a victim of XXXX XXXX  and rated XXXX  with XXXX for XXXX. She sent a male notary to my home where I was alone despite me requesting that a female notary from the sales office for my neighborhood do the closing. The closing attorney was not present and was not even aware of the closing and the broker or lender were not present in person or by phone at closing. I was having XXXX  and in a panicked state due to my XXXX and fear of being XXXX because of this male in my home and me alone. I was only given the signature pages of documents and told everything was as discussed with my lender and rushed through signing. After the last document was signed I was given copies. I immediately looked through them and absolutely nothing was as discussed or like the closing disclosures I had previously been given. The amounts for the debts were still incorrect and the same as they were the whole time and me telling her they were incorrect. I called XXXX and immediately told her that I didnt agree with the loan and that she lied and misled me. She said she was there to help me and she would get the amounts changed to wait until the checks arrived from disbursement. She again intentionally lied and misled me because she knew the checks would not arrive in time for me to rescend the loan and there was nothing I could do then. I got the checks and they were still wrong and third party payments in which my creditors would not accept and she refused to listen. She also admitted that they included my escrow refund in the documents as part of what I was getting cash in hand in order to get VA approval by making it look like I was benefitting from the refinance. Instead I was placed in financial detriment. None of my debts were paid off, my accounts closed because the disbursement company cancelled payments and said payments were unauthorized, fees were added, my credit was ruined, I had a XXXX mortgage payment, only received XXXX dollars at closing which all went to paying on debts they said they would pay and didnt even include, and a loan that did not benefit me at all and they knew I could not pay. This loan was fraud, predatory lending, and not extended in good faith and was designed to steal my equity and take my home. I have documentation in the form of emails and texts messages proving how I was lied to and mislead the whole time by XXXX XXXX and then her manager XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX. Then the loan was sold to Village Capital and Investments who are already trying to foreclose and force me into a loss mitigation agreement that is not helping me at all because it increases my payments even more. I can not even refinance because of the debt they didnt pay off and with my now ruined credit.

My non- Wells Fargo account was confirmed on XX/XX/XXXX. On Saturday XX/XX/XXXX I tried to transfer funds to my new non-Wells Fargo account. I was met with resistance. A page pops up telling me I needed to identity myself, to call Wells Fargo.This is a joke, considering the fact they wasn't concerned about my identity on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Both cases were thrown under the bus. Both checking and savings account will be closed this month. But why do I need permission to do business on my own account? It's as if they're holding my money hostage, to try to keep me from closing account. These people are crazy, this word is an understatement to describe the folk.

I made it clear that I was closing my card and wanted to make a final payment. I even asked if there were any recurring charges coming up for subscriptions. The specialist told me there were no recurring charges and what my balance was which I promptly paid.

Two weeks ago I got a notification that my credit score has changed. I contact XXXX, they said a pending charge hit the day after I closed the account. 

So I am immediately paid everything over the phone and placed a dispute for the credit reporting because they did not send me any information about any additional charges or balances after I closed the account. Not a single statement, phone call, letter, email, or text. I monitor my account balances with a financial program and the balance had shown XXXX since XXXX. 

After they pulled the phone call, a supervisor called me to tell me that she listened to the entire call. She confirmed it was my intent to close my card, that I asked about recurring charges, and that my history showed I have never been late with any payments. She also confirmed that they did not send me any notifications. 

But she said that I did not specifically ask if there were pending charges and that even though the specialist could see that on her screen and did not inform me of that, that is not a bank error that is my fault. Unbelievable! 

I asked if I could escalate this to a manager and she told me she was a supervisor and that there was nothing I could do. 

This is an unfair trade practice and just plain bad business. They should correct the credit reporting due to their negligence and egregious behavior. 

Hopefully you have the ability to have those phone calls pulled to see how ridiculous this is.

Additionally, I received a letter from AMEX on XXXX reporting a technical error on my account that may have affected the interest and fees on my account. I have attached that letter.

In XXXX of 2022, while I was on a trip in XXXX, XXXX, my credit card was used ( not by me ) to make a fraudulent transaction in the amount of {$890.00}. I did not make this transaction. As soon as I retuned from XXXX, I checked my credit card statement and noticed this fraudulent transaction. I immediately reported it to Wells Fargo. 

According to their own policies, Wells Fargo has the responsibility to reimburse me for any fraudulent transaction on my account. After several phone calls to their Credit Card Fraud Claims department ( I believe 5 phone calls so far ), Wells Fargo refuses to fulfill their responsibility and reimburse me for this transaction. After many phone calls, they finally sent me a one-page incomprehensible document ( attached here ) that they claim proves that I made the transaction and not someone else. It should be noted that they based their investigation based on this one page. 

At this point, I have no choice but to report Well Fargo to CFPB and hope you can resolve this issue. I have been a customer of Wells Fargo for over 8 years and had never claimed a fraudulent transaction until now. The one time that I fall victim to a financial fraud, they refuse to make me whole.

After unsuccessfully attempting to buy concert tickets the user claimed they were going to refund me the amount. After waiting for my refund and receiving nothing on XX/XX/XXXX the user told me I needed to deposit a cashier 's check for {$2500.00} into my bank account from their cousin so that they could pay me. I was to deposit the check and transfer the rest of the money to them. I voiced my discomfort with the transaction and the user began pressuring me by claiming that the money was for their rent and to feed their kids. After depositing I forwarded them the money on XX/XX/XXXX and told them I would not help them again. A few hours later the user sent me a message that a XXXX check was "" accidentally '' sent to me by their cousin and that I would need to send them that money. I once again retaliated saying I was not comfortable and that they needed to reverse the charge and send the money elsewhere. The user pressured me again saying that their car had broken down and had no food and needed the money. They texted and called my phone repeatedly. Due to the pressure of the constant texts and calls I sent them the money again in hopes that they'd leave me alone. Late on XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email correspondence from Wells Fargo that the checks bounced due to being fraudulent and that the money from the checks was charged back to my account. I only had {$200.00} in the account at the time so my account ended up negative {$2700.00}. Upon seeing this email I blocked the user.

I believe that Wells Fargo ( Visa-Signature Card ) is a collaborator in allowing fraud to be perpetrated on client Credit Card Accounts.

We agreed to that price, provided the vender our credit card info, and the vender then confirmed the reservation had been made and my credit card was debited for {$1500.00}. What? They added on {$510.00} for "" taxes and fees '' without breaking down what amount was taxes and what amount were fees in addition to my not agreeing to that price. The final debit amount was never disclosed in the conversation until she said it was too late to cancel.

On XX/XX/XXXX, Nissan XXXX  XXXX dealership paid off the car I had leased from them in full by mistake so my Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation "" NMAC "" car lease account was closed ... no futher payments could be made. 

2. Dealership went to arbitration to correct it and have my NMAC lease account reopened. 

3. I filled a complaint against the dealership with NCDOJ and XXXX but the dealership did not respond to either of them. 

4. Dealership executive manager accepted their error in XX/XX/XXXX and agreed : - to make my car payments for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX when NMAC reopens my lease account - to an additional refund of {$680.00} 5. No contacts were made by NMAC or the dealership with me ... no bills, explaination, notifications about a closed ornew account, warnings, repossession notice, etc. 

6. XXXX XXXX, NMAC opened a new lease account for the same car ( my prior account was still closed ), but did not inform me. 

7. On XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my NMAC account and found they had created a new account for the same car ... I checked my account status several times a week, and occationally, kept screen shots for my records. 

8. I attempted to make a payment via NMAC online app but it was rejected ... account not found. it appears the new account was not ready/fully functional to accept payments! 

9. On XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to make a payment via my own bank to my new NMAC account instead. 

10. On XXXX, XXXX, I received a call from NMAC to inform me that they had initiated to repossess my car as I had not made any payments for more than 91 days! 

11. The general manger of the dealership was also on the call so he attempted to make a payment while we were on the call ( via moneygram - as the only available option according to the NMAC agent ). The payment was not accepted as the new account was not found. 

12. The NMAC agent noticed the problem but said he could not stop the system generated automatic repossession untillMonday, XX/XX/XXXX. The agent also stated that my car may be repossessed over the weekend since the repossession order has already been sent out and reported to credit bureaus! 

I have now made all of my car lease payments, even up to XX/XX/XXXX, via my bank account. 

For the records, I understand thatNMAC had recently ( in XXXX ), paid $ XXXX in fines and agreed to submit a plan for CFPB approval that outlines how it will overhaul internal checks on repossessions, identify future wrongful repossessions and improve board oversight ... clearly they still have issues with their account opening and automated repossession system and procedures that should have been addressed by their compliance department.",None,NISSAN MOTOR ACCEPTANCE COMPANY LLC,NC,287XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,03/28/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6764362

1. Failure to Provide Validation Information I received a communication from CREDIT CONTROL CORP stating that I owe a debt of XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX However, the collection agency failed to provide me with the required validation information as outlined in 12 CFR 1006.34 ( b ) ( 5 ), which includes the amount of the debt, the name of the creditor, and a statement of my rights to dispute the debt. This omission violates my right to ensure the accuracy of the debt before it is reported to credit reporting agencies.

2. Lack of Opportunity to Dispute the Debt Furthermore, the collection agency has not provided me with a clear and straightforward method to dispute the debt, in violation of 12 CFR 1006.34 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( i ). This lack of access to the dispute process hinders my ability to challenge the validity of the debt.

3. False, Misleading, and Deceptive Practices The collection agency 's actions constitute a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681-s-2 ( 7 ) ( A ) by using false, misleading, and deceptive means to collect the debt. Their failure to provide validation information and opportunity to dispute creates an environment of pressure and confusion, which is unfair and unlawful. 

4. Furnishing Information to Credit Reporting Agencies Without Proper Disclosure Additionally, the collection agency 's attempt to report the debt to credit reporting agencies without providing the necessary disclosures outlined in 12 CFR 1006.34 ( d ) is a violation of my rights. This action could negatively impact my credit score without ensuring the legitimacy of the debt.

5. Request for Resolution Therefore, I am requesting the CFPB to inves
tigate these violations and take appropriate action against CREDIT CONTROL CORP This includes : Instructing the collection agency to cease all collection activities until they comply with the FDCPA.

Requiring the collection agency to provide me with the missing validation information and a clear process to dispute the debt.

Preventing the collection agency from reporting the debt to credit bureaus until its accuracy is verified.

Furthermore, I request the following documentation from the collection agency : Debt validation document as outlined in 12 CFR 1006.34 ( b ) ( 5 ).

Proof of their agreement to purchase the debt from the original creditor.

Verification of their license and bond status.

I have attached copies of all relevant documents, including the communication from the collection agency.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this complaint.

Flight number one was briefly delayed but otherwise uneventful. Flight number two experienced a significant delay of over two hours due to air conditioning issues, with the pilot personally explaining the situation to irate passengers. While many passengers received credits after contacting XXXX, my companion and I refrained from raising concerns and eventually boarded, arriving in XXXX XXXX hours later than expected. 

Flight number three was the best of the bunch, with only a brief delay. My companion received seat assignments for both flights XXXX and XXXX, but I received a ticket without a seat assignment for flight four. The worst travel experience occurred on flight four. Upon arrival in XXXX from flight three, we were notified of a two-hour delay, changing the departure time from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. We waited at the gate for hours without a gate agent present to address seat assignment issues. One hour before departure, the flight disappeared from the gate display, causing confusion among passengers. 

Flight attendants confirmed the gate was correct but could not assist with seat assignments. When gate agents finally arrived, they began boarding immediately, leaving no time to address the missing seat assignments. After all ticketed passengers boarded, the gate agent denied boarding to me and other remaining passengers, claiming the last passenger followed unknown instructions. I called my companion, who reported unoccupied seats on the plane and a flight attendant 's attempt to assist. The gate agent falsely accused me of "" cussing out '' the agent, then admitted I was just upset. My companion disembarked to support me, and a physical altercation occurred between the gate agent and another passenger. XXXX denied boarding to me and other passengers despite valid tickets, forcing us to book an alternative XXXX flight for {$750.00} to return home, nearly double the XXXX itinerary cost. 

We shared this experience with XXXX support on XX/XX/year>, and they offered a grossly insufficient {$15.00} refund. We then disputed the charge with Chase, requesting a refund for {$100.00}, representing one-quarter of the XXXX itinerary. Chase initially refunded the amount on XX/XX/year> but later denied the dispute and re-applied the amount on XX/XX/year>, citing XXXX 's false documentation of me as a "" XXXX '' for flight four. 

Due to XXXX XXXX ' mismanagement, significant delays, and fraudulent documentation of events, we were forced to book a last-minute XXXX flight to return home. I am requesting refunds for both the XXXX flight segment and the XXXX flight.

While sitting with our banker in the branch, she could see numerous charges coming through from in-person bank withdrawals to e-transfers to other ATM withdrawals and XXXX large wire transfer occurring all over the country. At the time these were occurring, we were sitting face-to-face with the banker in XXXX, NC. The banker immediately filed fraud claims for us on all deposits but we were advised that we "" needed to let the charges settle to the account before she could complete the claim process ''. The largest of these charges was a {$23000.00} wire transfer which Wells Fargo attempted to put a stop on. The stop did not work, and they filed a fraud claim. We were later informed that the amount listed on the fraud claim was {$0.00} and therefore the claims department had nothing to take action on. The claim was later revised and resubmitted by the branch, but we were told that they could not do anything further on this. 

We did receive credits for some of the fraudulent activity. Now, XXXX of those credits has been reversed without notice or without informing us of any findings on the side of Wells Fargo. We never received any credit for the {$23000.00} wire transfer. 

At the onset of these issues, we reached out to the FBI who initially followed up and were able to interview some of the branches where this fraudulent activity took place. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, having received no further updates from our local Wells Fargo branch, we escalated this matter to the XXXX XXXX  President ( Small Business & Retail ) - XXXX XXXX.

Their initial letter didn't give notice that I could dispute their collection, nor did it provide the option to opt out of their communication and furnishing. 

Caine & Weiner violated my rights and the laws of the FDCPA, first by NOT obtaining written permission to furnish information pursuant to 15 USC 1681 ( b ) ( 2 ).

( 2 ) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed. ( 3 ) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector.

The original on-line payment method was no longer accepted by the new bank. The new bank did not contact us regarding the change or provide information as to how to pay balances. We did not receive a monthly statements from the bank regarding the new account. 

After a couple months, we were alerted of suspicious activity by a credit monitoring company. 

We made multiple attempts to resolve the issue at local bank branches. We were told the account did not exist. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I located the account and called the bank. I was again told the account can not be located by the bank representative. After some conversation, the representative located the account.

The history on the account only reflected late fees and interest. The bank could not locate a charge associated with the interest and late fee. I asked for all late fees and interest be removed that accrued after the last payment.

The bank removed two late payments, and said they would send a notification of error to the credit score companies. 

I was called on XX/XX/XXXX and was told executive office had opened an investigation and I would be called back when the investigation had been concluded. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the bank because I had not heard anything from the bank. After an hour on the phone, and speaking to five different representatives. I was told the the investigation was completed. The result of the bank investigation was mailed to me on XX/XX/XXXX. The person who conducted the investigations was in the office but was not prepared to discuss the findings. 

I was told the summary of the investigation did not address why the the local bank branches were unable to locate the account, nor why the bank had no records of successfully contacting us regarding the bank purchasing the account. 

In summery, a bank purchased a credit card account from another bank. They claimed to have sent a letter, but we never received the letter. The bank stopped accepting on-line payment for the account. We discovered the problem with help from a third party. The bank could not locate the account on our attempts to pay the debt. When the bank finally located the account, their response was to only provide the day this bank purchased the account and when they mailed a letter. 

It is my opinion this bank is collecting late fees of {$40.00} a month, by blocking the customers ability to continue their on-line payments. This bank is asking for over {$200.00} from us, because they failed to contact me, by mail or phone, and they denied our requests to pay the balance at a bank branch.

O. Box 27170 Washington , DC 20038 XX/XX/XXXX RE : Consumer Complaint : Predatory Personal Loan - Wells Fargo ( WF ) Account Number XXXX - Paid in Full XX/XX/XXXX Incurred XX/XX/XXXX, Credit Card Consolidation : Wells Fargo & Sams Club Dear CFPB Director OR Designated Professional : Respectfully, I ask Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for review of the financial information and conditions established for the above-described Personal Loan from Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NC XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. [ Application ID XXXX at APR 13.494 % - initially it was 13.492 % ] This loan is paid in full, effective XX/XX/XXXX, without any late payments. 

I believe that I have been a victim of a Predatory Personal Loan from Wells Fargo. This Personal Loan consolidated my Wells Fargo credit card debt and Sams Club credit card debt, allegedly to lessen the amount of credit card interest debt that I would otherwise pay out over time. The purpose of my visit to Wells Fargo was to inquire about options that may be available to me for increasing my credit score and lowering my buildup of credit card interest amounts. I had recently learned that my credit score of XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX had decreased to XXXX in XXXX XXXX. Always, in my lifetime, my credit score has been above XXXX, and I wanted to keep it that way. 


On XX/XX/XXXX, I met with XXXX XXXX, Wells Fargo Personal Banker II, Small Business Advocate, with whom I explained my goal to find a way to increase my credit score and to find a way to help lower my credit card interest balance in paying off my Wells Fargo credit card. As a Banking professional, I thought her to have received specialized education and training. I trusted her to be a knowledgeable, trustworthy, skilled, efficient, honest, and sincere Personal Banker who could thoroughly inform and educate me about the matters for which I sought her help. I believed she was acting in my best interests. 

Wells Fargos adsorption of XXXX in XXXX signified that Wells Fargo had a recorded history of ALL my finances since XXXX - income ; taxes ; mortgage ; and meager savings, as well as my food, water, heating, and medical care payments. I informed the Personal Banker that all my financial records were available for her reference and consideration in the WF database. I shared everything about my personal financial situation with her, and I was clear to her that I would need her assistance and patience in helping me to understand all available banking options, procedures, and details, including definitions. I felt ashamed for needing support, and I thought being able to tell someone I trust would help. I give CFPB permission to access all my financial and related information in the databases ( XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo ). 

I explained to her that the monthly payments for the Loan amounted to more than I could afford, and to make the payments, I would need, again, to use my Wells Fargo credit card every month to supplement the cost of my food, medicine, gasoline, and all emergencies that would occur for me over the next 5 years. I thought that all those impending purchases on my WF credit card means that I will eventually end up paying much more interest every month to WF, and I have no savings. I shared all my hand-written notes and calculations with her, knowing that she, being a banking professional, could weigh my income and compare all payments I would be making for the Personal Loan and other expenses via my WF banking records. 

I had misgivings about the rate of interest ( 13.494 % ), the monthly payment amounts, and I was greatly disappointed that my having a mortgage with WF could not positively be considered towards my interest rate. She appeared to consult her manager on this. I know a home with or without a mortgage is still an asset. The Personal Banker told me that I "" did not have enough equity '' in my home- which I am financing through WF - therefore, she said, it would not positively affect my credit score towards the loan. In XXXX the property Taxable Amount was {$93000.00} ; now, in XXXX, the Taxable Amount is {$240000.00}. 

Yet, I was tired and felt encouraged to sign the papers. In hindsight, of course, I was stupid for signing! My XXXX XXXXXXXX puts me at risk, stalling my focus and concentration, when I am dealing with a time-consuming and thought-provoking matter. I did not realize the impact my XXXX XXXX had on my ability to manage money or the impact poor money management had on my XXXX XXXX. 


Regardless of those facts, I am aware that I have been victimized- and, perhaps, knowingly. It is my perception that the Professional Personal Banker is liable for negligence in her work, which, in turn, 'set me up to fail ' by contributing to my outrageous and extreme indebtedness for interest paid to Wells Fargo . Today, this very moment, I am indebted more than I was in XX/XX/XXXX, owing Wells Fargo nearly {$25000.00}. 

Over the past 15+ years, I have paid to Wells Fargo an enormous amount of interest. This solitary Personal Loan gained Wells Fargo much more than {$10000.00}, because I was paying interest on top of interest PLUS I needed to use the WF credit card monthly to supplement the needs that I had told the Personal Banker I would not be able to afford with the loan payments -- - more interest! 

Eight months later, after much searching, reading, reviewing, questioning, and studying online banking information, I understood that the Personal Banker II, with whom I had spoken for assistance and guidance, had failed to adequately counsel, inform, advise, support, and work with me in any proper, positive way that might benefit me or my financial status. Upon this realization, I emailed her twice, but she never replied to me. Then, I visited my local branch at WF XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC ) , where I had originally met with her to discuss my finances. I did not see her there, and a gentleman told me she was no longer there. So, I accepted that I was trapped in this loan until the last payment, made on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I am XXXX XXXX XXXX, supporting myself on my fixed income, AND I am paying off a WF Personal Loan that was of NO help to me and served no other purpose for me for the past five ( 5 ) years except to exacerbate my indebtedness, my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and my XXXX XXXXXXXX. I now know that the Personal Banker had more reasonable options she could have suggested... a balance transfer credit card or, better yet, simply recommend that - in lieu of monthly {$630.00} loan payments - I should use that money to increase my monthly current payments to my two creditors. I did not need that loan. 

As I stated earlier, for the past five years, I have been reading, inquiring, and educating myself on the US banking structure to prevent me from making future mistakes. The mistake I made in XX/XX/XXXX was : consulting with, listening to, questioning of, and trusting in the Wells Fargo Professional Personal Banker II to perform her job of Personal Banker accurately. 



I have read recently that CFPB classifies credit scores, i.e., "" What Makes Someone a Subprime Borrower? '' It caused me to wonder where exactly my XXXX Credit Score would have ranked in XXXX. The lowest scores from XXXX to XXXX are classified as "" near-prime, '' I read. Learning that, I wondered why my XXXX Credit Score - actually a PRIME Credit Score - had not benefitted me in obtaining a lower interest rate in XX/XX/XXXX? 

I can not afford an attorney, at this time, to review all information regarding this, my official claim to CFPB of Wells Fargo 's negligence or malpractice. If I had the geographical address of the Personal Banker II, I would share a copy of this information with her. Claims against banking professionals are limited in scope due to wide-reaching business judgment rules. Still, to resolve this issue, I respectfully request : [ 1 ] Wells Fargo 's answers or explanation of the situation that occurred in XX/XX/XXXX, such as "" Why, did the Personal Banker choose a Personal Loan for me, in lieu of a better choice, specifically when she knew the interest rate was so high? '' "" Why did she violate the duty of care or loyalty? '' Making payments on this loan caused me extreme financial, mental health, and emotional hardship. 

[ 2 ] "" Did the Personal Banker make her decision to offer me that unsecured Personal Loan without personal economic conflict? For example, did she and/or her manager later receive a reward in any manner - monetary, job promotion, company car, or other? 

[ 3 ] Respectfully, I ask CFPB to suggest a fair resolution. Absent that, I request a fair reversal of a fair amount of interest charges that I have paid to Wells Fargo throughout the past 5+ years : ( A ) For the Personal Loan period from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, AND ( B ) For the accumulating, ever-increasing interest on my blank WF credit card ( the loan paid it off ) that has accrued from XX/XX/XXXX, to date. 

That Personal Loan should never have been offered to me under the conditions and circumstances that existed at that time. 

[ 4 ] If any or all the above three requests are denied, I, respectfully, insist that CFPB or Wells Fargo promptly provide to me a written and itemized explanation for each denial.

I have been in contact with Freedom Mortgage numerous times since XXXX of XXXX trying to resolve this issue. They have all the recordings for "" Training Purposes ''. It is now XX/XX/2024 and I just received another letter stating that I am delinquent for a little more than {$2600.00}. Each time I call they acknowledge the issue say they will fix it. To date it is not resolved. Now it is costing me time and income to deal with this. They have been threatening foreclosure and now have reported this matter to the credit bureaus. They have also charged late fee 's. The service provider and XXXX XXXX are the ones at fault and are failing to resolve this matter. I have always paid the Mortgage on time for as long as I have had the Mortgage. I have spoken to numerous representatives including their representatives in the Tax analysis department and they acknowledge the problem of overcharging in the escrow account, but continue to fail to adjust the Mortgage payment to reflect what it should actually be.

This has caused a huge amount of duress for my wife whom is a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Veteran not to mention to myself dealing with the same issue time and time again with various Service Agencies that XXXX XXXX hires. They change service agencies like proud parents changing diapers. Each time the very same escrow issue arises, each time I have to file a complaint to get it resolved seeing one department does not speak to another department. Their lack of communication is not my problem, but it becomes a problem when they are threatening foreclosure and have ruined my credit score that needs to be fixed by them.

The procedure went over the estimated time due to medical necessity ( which was provided to my insurance carrier by my surgeon ). I received a bill from XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, GA, on or around XX/XX/year>.

Instead, they sold the invoice to Prince Parker and Associates, a debt collector. This immediately went on my credit report and affected my score.

08/28/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/year> I used the website XXXX to reserve a cabin in XXXX, TN for a family vacation at the mountains checking in XX/XX/XXXX, checking out XX/XX/XXXX for the total amount of {$6700.00} that I paid using my Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card. When we showed up at the cabin on XX/XX/XXXX we encountered that the cabin was not in the condition promised, to start with, the property manager called me stating that the cabin wasnt going to be ready at the checking time of XXXX as promised so our family we had to hang out somewhere else until they were done cleaning the cabin. Later that day around XXXX we got to the cabin and noticed that I was given the wrong access code to the cabin and we were locked out the place until I called the property manager and she provided her personal code for us to access. We are in the cabin and noticed how dirty it was, trash was still in the trash cans, the floors were filthy and the water to the whole house smelled like rotten eggs. I communicated all of the issues to the property manager and she did resolve some of them but not all. One of the main issues es the water in the hot tub, there was oil floating on top, white flakes floating in the water and even some toenails, I made the property manager aware and she sent someone the next day to overflow the hot tub in order for the oil to spill out, not change the water, only overflow it which did not resolve the issue. Many other complaints were made to the property manager I cant list or explain all of them but I have photos, videos and messages from the property manager to prove all and each of them. A couple of days before we were to check out my sister ( one of the guests at the cabin ) started having a bad headache, we run to the store and got XXXX thinking it was something simple, the next day she got worse and started running a fever, we still didnt think any of it and the next day we were checking out so she planned on going to the doctor when home. The day we checked out since we drove separate vehicles my sister and her family went a different way, we were getting close to home when her husband calls me to tell me that he is taking her to the emergency room because her fever is really high, she is shaking and XXXX is no longer working. I remember talking to her the day before and we were trying to figure out what was going on. She told me that she got in the hot tub and when she was going in, she noticed the tub was slimy and she slipped and fall, she didnt worry about it because she didnt hit herself but she ended up going underwater for a few seconds, she got out and didnt go back in. She made it to the hospital and was told that she had a bad XXXX XXXX because she had XXXX in her ears caused by dirty water, the water in the hot tub, she was at the hospital two days where she was given XXXX for the pain because it was so bad. I immediately contacted XXXX to let them know what was going on and asked for a partial refund so to all the struggles we went through at the cabin and more than anything to compensate for what my sister was going through. I told them I wanted to help her pay the hospital bill since I felt guilty for what had happened to her. It was quite a fight and after back and forward emails with XXXX, unanswered messages to the host/owner XXXX XXXXs and property manager XXXX, XXXX ended up refunding me the service fee of {$770.00}, they were not able to refund the rest because the host/owner used a third party managing company ( XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ) to charge for the rest of the balance which was {$5900.00} so I had to deal with them directly which doesnt not make sense since I used the XXXX platform for the reservation and thought they were the ones handling everything but anyway I dealt with the host as well, I sent several messages through XXXX website because I didnt have a direct number, I didnt have a number for the property managing company, the only thing I have is the phone number to the property manager XXXX but according to her she doesnt deal with refunds, the host/owner XXXX XXXX handles that but he doesnt answer messages and there is not a phone number where I can reach him directly. I also filed a claim through my bank since I could not get a hold of the host/owner but days after Wells Fargo closed the dispute alleging that they provided the service they promised a cabin, I guess the filthy status of the cabin did not matter, it didnt matter that someone ended up at the hospital due to this. I called the bank and argued that XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX didnt provide the service they promised, because they promised a clean cabin, a timely check in time, clean premises with all essentials included and they did not kept the promise sending someone to the hospital. Wells Fargo had proof of everything, photos, videos, messages, descriptions, etc. I argued that in one of the message conversations with property manager XXXX, she even admits that the cabin is not in good condition to be rented and I believe this conversation was not taken into consideration, I believe Wells Fargo back just jumped into the conclusion that a cabin was provided and that was it, they close the case with an unfavorable decision against me. At this time after all the wasted time with the bank I kept fighting with XXXX and this time I didnt want a partial refund, I wanted ALL my money back {$5900.00} we fought for a while and finally on XX/XX/year> I received a message from the host on XXXX website that reads the following Weve processed your refund. It may take up to 15 days for this refund to reflect in your original for of payment. Please contact your bank for further updates. I felt relief and waited for the money to post to my Wells Fargo Credit Card account. The date today is XX/XX/year> and the money is still not in my account. XXXX suggested to initiate a chargeback process with my bank Wells Fargo but they argued that this cant be done because the dispute is being closed. I also messaged the host to find out whats going on and got no answer. According to XXXX, they contacted him as well and they did get a response from him, this is what the email from XXXX reads I am contacting you as agreed in the previous email to inform you that the last request sent to the property manager to confirm the refund has been answered and they, as those responsible for the property, have denied that they will process any refund of the rental payment. After promising a refund back in XX/XX/XXXX, they backed up and now they dont want to refund the money. I am really disappointed, specially with my bank Wells Fargo, I have been banking with them for more than 20 years and they cant even fight this for me. The bank, the host/owner, the property manager and XXXX  are getting away with this, really?? Where are we as customers left in a situation like this? I know that my sisters hospital bill will be higher that the full refund I am requesting, I feel guilty and obligated to help her with the expenses and this refund will definitely help us. Wells Fargo Bank has evidence of all issues with the cabin, including photos, videos, screenshots of conversations with property manager XXXX and with host/owner XXXX XXXX XXXX photos of my sister at the hospital showing dates, they had all the evidence that proved that XXXX violated their Book With Confidence Guarantee mentioned in their website.

I stated that it was not visible online and to show me where it stated that. No one, including the first representative or the one dealing with the Wells Fargo website could do that. I told them that I wanted it in writing so that if it did not get extended then I could show it was offered. The representative stated that they could not do that until the most recent payment was paid. I told her that it was paid ( {$0.00} due ) therefore, all the conditions have been met so could she put it in writing. Initially she indicated that she could fax me a letter, then while I waited, she said that she could not, only mail it. I said "" ok, go ahead and mail it ''. Then she proceeded to say it would take 15-20 days for me to receive it? So again, I might not receive it until XX/XX/XXXX when my APR could potentially go to a XXXX interest rate or higher. Doesn't this go against the Fair Credit Act whereby the customer is suppose to be notified of the APR?

But in XX/XX/XXXX I started getting sick with a XXXX that left me out of work and no income for a long period. As it onset I called WF to see options we had since I could not pay the loans on time. I was told to sell or refinance buy a deferment was never an option. I was given a terrible time through phone support. Even while in a wheelchair for 3 months of treatment and rehab I was being criticized for sound money spending to make a payment even though I had no income. I had 2 other companies i had vehicle loans with and immediately they did a deferment. Not WF. Until I had missed 3-4 payments would they even consider talking about things. We missed somewhere around 6-8 payments. When I started back I was in arrears and they started the foreclosure process and had to pay the full amount to avoid foreclosure. Even though I was still, and am, XXXX from my XXXX they wanted every penny at once. Sell, or foreclose. So I had to borrow the money from a friend to pay it off to avoid losing. My credit was so bad from lack of work and income that was the only way to get the funds. Took me a year to pay the friend as I had all.my other bills to catch up on from such a long absence of work. They were awful the whole process. I had other issues on the loan and paperwork as well. After my experience, even just the paper work and competency of the loan process, I would never do a loan or recommend to anyone. It was a horrible process.

The initiation fee for the credit card was {$250.00} and under the advertised terms of the card, American Express would credit the card holder ( me ) {$400.00} after the card had been used to purchase a Delta XXXX flight. Additionally, American Express agreed to credit the card holder with XXXX Delta miles after {$3000.00} had been charged to the card within the first XXXX months. I achieved both of these milestones within the allocated time. 

Beginning in XX/XX/2022, I called American Express to find out why I had received neither the {$400.00} credit nor the XXXX miles. I was told both were "" in process '' and that I would receive them shortly. After three further calls over the following several weeks I was finally told that American Express had decided to not credit the {$400.00} or the XXXX miles because I had had other American Express cards in the past which I had cancelled. ( I don't keep a record of my credit cards but I estimate I have had 3-4 American Express cards over the past 30 years ). I explained to the American Express agent that if American Express did not wish to honor these credits it should not have accepted my application in the first place. Furthermore, by accepting my application and charging me, and receiving, the {$250.00} initiation fee there was a de facto offer and acceptance of the advertised terms. 

After several attempts politely asking American Express to honor its commitment, I canceled the credit card and explained to an agent at American Express that I was leaving a balance on the card of {$250.00} as an offset against the initiation fee which I had paid when I received the card.

This promotion was the sole reason I decided to obtain the XXXX XXXX XXXX, despite already being a holder of two other Chase cards.

During my attempts to secure a credit card from Wells Fargo Bank, my applications were repeatedly declined, with bank representatives insisting that I needed to provide proof of XXXX citizenship or XXXX residency. It is important to note that this requirement was never communicated in any pre-application documentation or during the application process, and there is no public disclosure of such a requirement as a condition for credit card approval by Wells Fargo. 

Of great concern is the fact that two acquaintances with immigration and residency statuses similar to mine were able to obtain credit cards from the same Wells Fargo branch without any issues. This discrepancy in treatment has led me to believe that there is an inconsistency in the bank 's application evaluation process. 

In an effort to address this issue, I visited the branch and filed a complaint for resolution within the Wells Fargo system.

I had a recent financial setback resulting in my account balance being short of my monthly rent payment of {$1400.00}, and I initiated the payment on XX/XX/year>, knowing that would result in an overdraft fee of {$35.00}, and it was either pay the {$35.00} overdraft fee, or pay an even more severe financial penalty from the apartment complex. However, I had XXXX additional charges that were made following this payment for rent, which resulting XXXX additional overdraft penalties, totaling {$170.00} in overdraft fees.

Each time the representative did sympathize with my situation, and each time I asked if there is anything else that could be done, for I do not receive my next paycheck until XX/XX/year>, and any additional reimbursements of these XXXX overdraft penalties would greatly relieve my current financial situation. The overdraft penalties I received after my rental payment, I had tried to stop the payments on these XXXX charges from going through and it was to late, therefore, resulting {$140.00} in overdraft fees on top of the original {$35.00} overdraft fee for my rental payment. I have been trying my best to reduce my spending and save more money, but I am at the mercy of the current economic climate, and to be refunded these overdraft fees would be beneficial to my current financial situation, for these fees could have gone to my other monthly bills. I understand Wells Fargo is a business and can charge what they want for overdraft fees, but it is incredibly predatory to continue stacking overdraft fees on financially struggling consumers. I feels like, in my honest opinion, that is expensive to be poor, as someone that is also employed by XXXX of the biggest banks in XXXX, I find it hard to believe that the call center representatives that handle these situations are at the mercy of the Wells Fargo "" system '' and can not go above and beyond to help override situations like the one I have described.

They were supposed to take me out, but the representative messed up and did not process my acceptance of the modification. This took countless phone calls and time to get them to correct this last year. 

- After the nightmare of them not removing me properly from forbearance, they sent me a letter saying they could begin the foreclosure process anytime, when I was current. I called and no one could tell me why that letter came to me. Isn't it illegal to threaten to foreclose on a home that is current? 

- Currently, Wells Fargo has had my full payment since XX/XX/XXXX. Tomorrow will be a week since they received all the funds. They received the majority of the funds from the North Carolina Home Owners Assistance Fund back in XXXX but did not put it on the account for almost two weeks. I was waiting to make sure they put the funds on the account and then I made the remaining payment on XX/XX/XXXX. To date, I'm showing past due on their site, as I'm passed the "" grace period '' for my payment. Which they have the entire payment ( since XX/XX/XXXX ). I spoke with Wells Fargo to discuss this matter on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Both times, I was assured it would not go passed the grace period. These actions are absolutely unfair and deceptive acts and practices. How can a bank have your entire payment for a week, keep it sitting in "" unapplied funds '' even after the customer has called numerous times?",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NC,28278,None,Consent provided,Web,04/19/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6855246

Wells Fargo has misappropriated my funds. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I called into Wells Fargo and paid {$1600.00} for the storage of my escrow while on a modification trial. I was informed by my case manager XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and an Executive Office Case Specialist XXXX XXXX case # XXXX in writing that my funds would go toward the escrow storage and all I needed to do is make up the difference for the trial period as the end all funds would be applied appropriately, and my payment would be under {$880.00}. I filed a complaint with CFPB Wells Fargo sent in the following response below : Thank you for the opportunity to address the concerns about the trial plan payments and final modification figures. We've reviewed your concerns and are providing you with details about our findings. The escrow shortage payment made in XX/XX/XXXX was applied to escrow as intended. The trial plan payments were required to be made in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. We found you were given inaccurate information during the XXXX conversations you had with our home preservation team in XX/XX/XXXX. You were advised you didnt need to pay the XX/XX/XXXX and only a portion of the XX/XX/XXXX trial payment. We apologize for the misinformation you were given and have remediated the account in the amount of {$1600.00} so that we can issue new modification documents to properly adjust the account as you had intended and what you were told would happen. Here are important account details we'd like you to know. We will be applying the {$1600.00} as trial payments and will be drafting new modification documents. You may be required to make a XX/XX/XXXX payment. We will monitor this until the new documents get released. I'm glad we spoke about your concerns. I appreciate the opportunity to help you, and I've attached a copy of our response letter.

On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Amex telling me my payment to a vendor was declined. I was not close to my credit limit, so I logged in to my Amex account online. I saw a message telling me my account had been suspended. I called Amex and was told they suspended my account because I was working with a debt resolution company. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have never even spoken with any such company. 
I asked the representative to tell me what debt resolution company claimed I was using their services and was told that Amex doesn't have that information. I pressed further and spoke with agents and their supervisors in multiple departments and continued to be told they did not have the information. I asked how they received information about my credit from an anonymous source! Nobody could give me the information, nor could they explain how the report came to be. 
I was very upset, thinking my identity had been stolen. Between all of the calls with Amex and researching my personal credit report and paying for a business credit report, I wasted hours of time and still had no answers.Amex said they would submit a request to review my account and try to reactivate it, but it could take seven days. Meanwhile, none of my vendors are being paid.I also have to get a new card, so I'll waste more time changing my account number with all of my vendors. 
I called again today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and was connected to an agent who reactivated my account and told me it was an internal error at Amex. This is completely unacceptable.

( At this point, I was stranded in the IST airport ) XXXX XXXX reneged on the agreement to refund my credit card and stopped responding to my inquiries after I returned to the United States. Chase has failed to thoroughly investigate this matter not once, but twice, as I did appeal the first dispute. I have been a Chase customer since XXXX, and am appalled by the complete incompetence by Chase. There is absolutely no point in having a XXXX XXXX credit card if I can't count on the travel protection benefits they claim to offer. 

I spent over two hours on the phone with XXXX XXXX customer service on XX/XX/XXXX while stranded in the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was denied boarding onto my original flight returning to XXXX. The airline made a gate assignment error. There was no gate number information printed on my boarding pass when there should have been, nor were there any gate information announcements throughout the airport, or updated gate change information sent to me via phone or email, despite the fact that I included this information when I purchased my flight. Not only that, the gate information that was displayed on the flight information display system was incorrect. 

XXXX XXXX not only denied me boarding on my original flight for their own error ( no/ incorrect gate number ), they also charged me to book a replacement flight returning to the United States even after saying that they would not do so. I waited in line at the XXXX XXXX information desk for an hour only to be told to call a customer service line that I had to call back numerous times because I kept getting hung up on. XXXX XXXX agreed to refund the purchase of the {$370.00} agent fee and the {$1400.00} additional flight charge but then rescinded it later, which is in violation of my Passenger Rights per their website. 

I provided all of these details to XXXX XXXX in-person, over the phone, and in writing, I also sent an email with photo documentation of the gate omission on my boarding pass per their request, only to have them renege and charge my credit card anyway. Per the last customer service agent I spoke with I should have received a refund within two weeks after they confirmed they received the photo of my boarding pass. I sent all documentation to Chase including a photo of the boarding pass, and email correspondence from the customer service agent agreeing to the refund. 

I spent an additional six hours at the airport and therefore experienced a significant delay in reaching my destination city, all because the airline left out critical information. Ultimately, Chase 's failure to resolve this issue adds significant insult to injury, and they need to take accountability for their underhanded business practices.

XXXX. **Lack of Express Written Consent : ** None of these agencies have obtained my express written consent to collect or disseminate my personal information.

XXXX. XXXX*Illegal Profit from Personal Data : ** My personal information has been transmitted illegally by these agencies to third parties for their own profit, from which I have derived no benefit.

These practices breach the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and 15 U.S.C. 6802, and demonstrate a blatant disregard for my rights and safety, potentially exposing me to identity theft and financial fraud. The systemic failure of these agencies to uphold privacy and integrity of consumer data is alarming.

Firstly, I require documentation proving that I provided express written consent for JPMCB to report the inquiry in question. As there is no evidence of such consent or a court order, I must assert that this inquiry lacks legitimacy and is thus subject to removal.

Per the FCRA Section 605B, a consumer reporting agency must block the reporting of any information resulting from alleged identity theft when identified by the consumer. Therefore, I am formally notifying JPMCB to remove this inquiry from my file within four business days.

07/23/24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","Dear CFPB, I am writing to file a complaint against Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance , Inc. regarding their handling of my mortgage following my XXXX XXXX  bankruptcy discharge. My mortgage account was included in my bankruptcy case, which was discharged on XX/XX/XXXX. Despite this, Vanderbilt Mortgage has taken legal action against me, including filing a civil summons. Vanderbilt Mortgage contacted me on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX over the phone about the outstanding balance on my mortgage. I requested a loss mitigation so my home will not go into foreclosure which they were not able to offer because they denied it. However, after receiving the civil summons filed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. on XX/XX/XXXX, I called to discuss my account and options. The law firm instructed me to discuss everything with the mortgage company which I did. Being I also have XXXX XXXXXXXX due to the Covid 19 pandemic and this financial hardship I am still trying my best. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX from Vanderbilt Mortgage called and He asked if I could pay the past due amount of {$18000.00}. I requested payment arrangements due to my XXXX XXXX discharge, but he repeatedly stated that the case was dismissed due to non-payment, which is incorrect. I also inquired if they had received my answer to the complaint, and he mentioned that he had just received an email about it before our call. XXXX XXXX said he would contact the attorney, and I should as well, to confirm receipt of the notice and discuss the next steps. I also received a notice through USPS about a hearing set for XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX. I believed that following my XXXX XXXX discharge, Vanderbilt Mortgage should not contact me personally about the mortgage debt. Their continued contact and the civil summons have caused significant stress and confusion along with the financial hardship I am facing. I believe their actions may violate consumer protection laws and discharge injunction pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 524 ( a ) ( 2 ). Enclosed with this letter are copies of my XXXX XXXX  bankruptcy discharge order and recent communications with Vanderbilt Mortgage. I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate this matter and assist in finding a resolution. Thank you for your attention to this issue.

American Express refused to divulge what affiliation this was, and closed my account based off a couple returned payments and a suspected affiliation with a charge on the credit card.

01/06/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"XXXX, Thank you for your prompt and courteous response to the mistreatment I have been receiving for months at the hands of Chase Bank. Also, many thanks as well for your concern. 

I assure you and Southwest I shall continue to fly on your airline as I have done since my early business flights back in the XXXX. 

Over the last year Chase has canceled and reissued my credit card account number 6 times where I have retained and documented this activity on the part of Chase.

Chase advises this policy is initiated each time I fail to recognize a charge. I have opined numerous times to simply cancel the charge and partner with me in monitoring charges as I do on a weekly ( sometimes more frequently ) basis.

Each time Chase issues a new credit card number and card, I must spend hours on the phone calling my monthly bills ( creditors ) to report a new card. This activity must wait 5 to 7 business days until my new card arrives in the mail via of regular mail where it is ( as ) or more vulnerable to theft or being lost in the mail ; creating a greater credit threat than any single unrecognized charge. 

At last, check my credit score was near or just above XXXX. Today in the mail I received 4 cancelation notices as Chase did not process my automated premium payment for my homeowners, auto, umbrella, and scheduled items floater ; leaving me with 15 days to make a payment by alternative methods or face having no homeowners, auto, umbrella liability, and valuable articles coverage. 

I have copied my congressman on this email, and I am filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau where I shall copy both your office and Congressman XXXX XXXX on this email and shall provide a copy of my complaint to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to Chase, Southwest Airlines, and XXXX XXXX. 

I believe action to prevent the above practice should be taken immediately not only because of its negative impact on consumer credit, ability to pay monthly bills, possible negative impact on credit scores, but also because this policy is applied broadly by Chase and is only intended to protect their financial institution without regard or even the slightest care for the consumer, their customer. 

In addition, I am asking XXXX XXXX to consider legislation that would require all banks to initiate recovery actions against predators who make fraudulent postings. 

I have spent 45 years investigating insurance claims, fraud, money laundering, mail fraud, and I can tell you with all certainty ; Chases fraud department is a sham!

It is sad that such a fine airline as Southwest would expose their long standing and frequent flyers to such un-caring service that lacks the flexibility to place your good customers financial interest ahead of their recalcitrant corporate policy. 

Respectfully, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, NC XXXX XXXX XXXX From : XXXX XXXX XXXX Sent : Friday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX To : XXXX Subject : Southwest Airlines Response to your Inquiry ( Case XXXX XXXXXXXX ) Dear XXXX, Thank you for taking the time to contact us. As a valued Rapid Rewards Member, I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your concerns. 

Im sorry to know that you remain disappointed with the Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Credit Card from Chase. Although Chase must address your concerns directly, that doesnt mean we arent saddened to learn about your continued frustration. We use feedback like yours to ensure that our Customers find value in the service that we provide, including our relationships with our Partners, and your feedback will be made available to our Senior Leadership.

10/12/23,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Can't close your account,"On Monday, XX/XX/2023 I called Nordstrom Card Services to close my consumer Nordstrom Visa Signature credit card ending in XXXX. On this call I was told that the account had been closed as I had requested, when in fact the account had not been closed. I have made several attempts since then to close my Nordstrom Visa Signature credit card account over the phone and Nordstroms Card Services continues to make excuses, transfer me to different departments and even tell me again that the card has been closed, when in fact it remains open. Nordstrom Card Services has deliberately refused my wishes and intentions to close my Nordstrom Visa Signature credit card ending in XXXX- on multiple occasions. I have recorded calls of the conversations and have been specific about my intention to have my credit card closed. More detail about this issue follows : In early XX/XX/2023, my Nordstrom Visa Signature card became unusable for purchases. It was frozen/locked for purchases, although I could still make payments. This was odd and not something that I anticipated. I called Nordstrom Card Services several times from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX asking for reasons why my account was frozen/locked. I was told that my account was "" under review '' and was given no explanation of why this was so or when the "" review '' will conclude. 

I had done nothing wrong with this account, have used the card in the same way for the multiple years that it has been open, have been a loyal Nordstrom customer, and have made all payments on time and have had an otherwise current and good account standing. 

I patiently waited weeks for the "" review '' of my account to conclude and on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX I called Nordstrom Card Services to close my consumer Nordstrom Visa Signature credit card ending in XXXX. 

I had made debit card payments in Nordstrom stores over the weekend ( XXXX XXXX ) to pay off my balance. In fact, to make sure there was no remaining balance, I overpaid on the account and had a credit/negative balance of approximately - {$400.00}. 

On the call to Nordstrom Card Services on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX I asked the services agent on a recorded line if it was possible for me to close the account and was specifically told "" yes ''. I then proceeded with my request to close the account. Before concluding the call, I asked if the account was closed and the Nordstrom Card Services agent told me/verified that the account was closed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Nordstrom Card Services to double check that my account was closed and to my shock, learned the the account was not closed on XX/XX/XXXX as I had requested. I asked that the account be immediately closed. That closure again did not take place. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I also called Nordstrom 's Experience Line ( XXXX ) and left a message explaining the situation, inquiring as to why Nordstrom Card Services continues to defy my wishes and not close my credit card account, and also asking that my credit card account be immediately closed. The request for closure did not take place. This "" customer experience '' number appears to only have voicemail options available for inquiries. 

Early on XX/XX/XXXX, I was on vacation outside of the XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. However on XX/XX/XXXX I received a voicemail from ( XXXX ) at Nordstrom Card Services saying the request to close the account effective "" today '' or on XX/XX/XXXX. This closure again DID NOT take place. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I again called Nordstrom Card Services and inquired about the situation and repeated my request to have my credit card account ending in XXXX to be immediately closed. On this call, I spoke with XXXX ( a card services representative in TX ) and was directly told - again - that my account had been closed. Later on the call I asked XXXX specifically when my account was closed, and she responded that the account had not been closed but was set to be closed on or by XX/XX/XXXX. I was astonished and couldn't believe that 1 ) my account had not been closed 2 ) I was again told that my credit card account had been closed when in fact it had NOT. 

This is a similar pattern that Nordstrom Card Services is employing. I call in to Nordstrom Card Services and ask that my credit card account be immediately closed, they tell me it has been, but when I ask for more detailed information, then my account turns out to not have been closed. I asked for names of managers who have been connected with the decision to not grant my wishes and close my account and XXXX mentioned the name of a manager named XXXX or XXXX- a name that I've heard before - and someone who appears to be directly connected with the intentional decision to not close my credit card account against my explicit wishes to do so. 

I am asking that Nordstrom Card Services immediately close the account ( as requested by me, the consumer cardholder, and NOT a closure by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

What is also troubling here is that there appears to be an explicit attempt by managers like Evonne/Yvonne at Nordstrom Card Services to keep my account open against my wishes. This is absolutely deliberate. I would like a detailed explanation of why this has been done and who are the people responsible for doing so. I had hoped to close my account in peace and avoid a CFPB complaint and also legal recourse, but Nordstrom Card Services has continuously, consistently and blatantly denied my request for account closure.

This has been extremely stressful and time consuming. I have made several recorded calls to Nordstrom Card services asking for additional detail about why my explicit wishes to close the account that have not been followed. I have had take time away from work to communicate with Nordstrom Card Services, record calls, log written notes, and detail what has happened to my account. I have done nothing wrong, have been a good and loyal customer to Nordstroms, have always made payments to my Nordstroms credit card account on time, and have abided by payment terms and conditions that Nordstrom Card Services has set forth and have a current account in good standing. Yet Nordstrom Card Services has intentionally refused to abide by my repeated requests to close my credit card request.

I have recorded my calls and interactions with Nordstrom Card Services and assume Nordstrom Card Services has recorded the calls too. There should be no discrepancy about my intent to close my credit card account or about the deliberate refusal of Nordstrom Card Services to abide by my wishes and close the account.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,NC,28209,None,Consent provided,Web,10/12/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7689180

I asked to have my name and my son 's mother 's named removed from his checking account so we could not longer see his transactions. He is XXXX and deserves his privacy. 

However, the Wells Fargo representative told me all three of us had to go to a branch to have our names removed from his account. I then explained our son is away at college and my ex-wife and I do not live near each other any more. The representative then told me we could each go to a different branch and have a conference call with the branches and they "" might '' be able to remove us from his account. Emphasis on "" might. '' Further, trying to find a time convenient for the three of us when three different branches have the same appointment times seems to be insurmountable. Our son is in college, and both his mom and I work.

Her next suggestion was that since each of us had access to his account, we could close the account and then he could open another account on his own. I found these suggestions unacceptable.

Then I tried to file a complaint on Wells Fargo 's website while signed into the account. I searched "" How do I file a Complaint. '' No results were found. Instead, I received a message saying "" If you did not find what you are looking for, try the results from our public website. '' I attached an image of these results. 

Then I went to www.wellsfargo.com site and searched again for "" How do I file a complaint. '' The results of that search returned XXXX results even after I narrowed down the search results by selecting XXXX filters. I also attached an image of the results from this search with this complaint. 

I then started scrolling through those XXXX results and gave up after not finding instructions. Probably after XXXX results or so, not the entire XXXX. I believe the search results are non-productive and maybe even intentional so customers get frustrated and give up on filing a complaint. 

Can there be any easier way to there any easier way to find out how to file a complaint other than searching in the manner in which I did in both ways which the bank suggested?

All my money was available. Ive done a total of 3 to 4 withdrawals within the past week. When I asked this question, the lady simply asked me can I tell her those dates she did not ask me what app That I needed to use to tell her when the dates of these transactions occurred I went off the dates and once she seen she was incorrect she proceeded to cut me off once she seen that she couldve potentially been wrong so then she proceeded to tell me that there was nothing I could do to try to fix it while I was asking if I could potentially get somebody else on the phone I was asking before I started asking politely but frustrated and the more of a hard time as she tried to give me about giving the phones to somebody else I didnt ask for her supervisor or her manager or anything I just asked to speak to somebody else she then began trying to stall out on my request this week somebody else which frustrated me more then after I asked repeatedly about 30 times to be transferred to somebody else she agreed to get the escalations department, which I never heard of on the line got the gentleman on the line and right before she got off the line she laughed at my case scenario which I found was extremely disrespectful I dont care how much the amount is. Im tired of the bank overdrawing a account that is not legible for overdrawing With my question was simply it was on the bank and there is a wire transfer fee how come this was the first wire transfer fee charge I received after my previous wire transfers because this doesnt occur when I have money just sitting in my account but when my account balance is low, all of a sudden you wan na hit me with fees they continue to blame it on the merchant and the merchant processing system, which is in my opinion another lie because it doesnt make sense to let somebody leave your store without paying for an item or with transaction pending for however, long, the bank wants to post the transaction at their discrepancy so when I spoke to XXXX XXXX, he tried to go the same route with me I had to stop him and let him be aware that he was carrying the conversation that way by over exaggerating on my statement I that I felt them blaming the merchants processing system was a lie, and once I expressed that XXXX XXXX proceeded to tell me that I was telling him that he was lying. After he said a statement like I was repeatedly telling him he was just lying on everything he was saying, which was fault. I asked him excuse me, sir how many times did I tell you that I was lying and is this not just the first time Im telling you I feel like your life I seen that he had a pre-in his mind not to be of any assistance either to just restore his coworkers pride all because his coworker was wrong if you guys as in Wells Fargo, the company want to hire people that do not want to do customer service or have issues doing customer service do you need to remove the customer service department altogether and just replace it with XXXX, after all you trained, yall employees to deal with their customers like their homeless begging for change so when it comes to reverse thing an error, are yall behalf that something minor {$15.00} all of a sudden its not such a Small amount of cash perhaps this is why the companys profit and loss ratio is the way it is its because the employees are miss handling money on purpose and it keeping away from their customers I understand that theyre gon na make this look like this is just something that continuously happens but this is not something that I would be frustrated. This satisfied or extremely uncomfortable with my business account is overdrawn {$140.00} and Im not worried about that at all simply because I am aware of all of the charges so it is not a case of oh, he needs money because I have another schedule to withdraw coming to the account from my brokerage account.

It really doesnt make sense as to why all my pending transactions were approved within the day I made a purchase leaving my whole account on negative. Thankfully I wasnt charged over fees since at that time they were still doing the get pay early through direct deposit.

In the letter to XXXX ( dated XXXX XXXX XXXX  ), I indicated that I was a former customer of XXXX, that I previously had 5 XXXX loans serviced by XXXX, and that the loans had been paid in full and closed. I further informed XXXX of my attempts at asking the credit bureaus to remove the closed accounts from my account history, given that the late payment history in the closed accounts were inhibiting my ability to qualify for other forms of credit. To date, XXXX is the only bureau to honor my request and to remove the closed accounts from my credit report. Unfortunately, XXXX, XXXX, and Innovis will not remove the accounts UNLESS XXXX INSTRUCTS THEM DIRECTLY TO REMOVE THE CLOSED ACCOUNTS. The basis of my request was that the closed accounts were old ( opened between XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and that none of the bureaus had record of the first delinquency dates to validate and justify removal. Only XXXX had that information on hand. Given that I have satisfied the accounts and that they are now closed, I have asked XXXX to tell XXXX, XXXX, and Innovis to delete the closed accounts from my account history. This will help increase my chances of qualifying for a home mortgage, auto loan, and lower auto insurance rates. XXXX Credit Bureau Management responded with a letter on XX/XX/XXXX completely missing the point to my letter and stating that I was disputing the accuracy of the information reported to the credit bureaus. I responded with a second letter ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) basically calling them out on misunderstanding my initial letter. I stated that the intent behind my letter was not to dispute the accuracy of the information reported to the credit bureaus. Rather, the intent behind my initial letter was to tell XXXX to instruct removal of the 5 CLOSED student loan tradelines from my XXXX, XXXX, and Innovis credit reports. The tradelines are OLD and CLOSED. THE BUREAUS ARE WILLING TO DELETE THE CLOSED ACCOUNTS, BUT CAN NOT DELETE UNTIL XXXX INSTRUCTS THEM TO. Based on my research, I know creditors often instruct credit bureaus to remove old tradelines, especially when requested. I asked XXXX again to contact XXXX, XXXX, and Innovis, and to tell them to remove the closed tradelines from my reports. The credit bureaus will remove the tradelines, but they can not remove the tradelines until XXXX tells them to do so. I have confirmed this with the credit bureaus. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX replied with another letter again missing the point to my two previous letters. I did not ask them to investigate the accuracy of their reporting. All I wanted was for them to tell the bureaus to delete the XXXX closed accounts from my reports. The bureaus will not delete the accounts until XXXX tells them to do so, and XXXX ( for some odd reason ) will not budge. As a consumer, I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I have done my part and have paid off the loans. The least they could do ( as a goodwill adjustment ) is help delete the delinquent accounts and payment history from my reports so that I can get on the road to financial freedom and security.

I spoke to multiple reps and was hung up on while attempting to resolve this matter. The funds were still in the account for the payment being made so I asked if we can process the payment via debit since they were having problems processing it via ACH. I transferred the funds to my account that has a debit card linked to it and provided the rep with the card number. They stated they were having issues on their end with the payment. I asked if they would like to try another card. They stated they would try my card on file and read me the number. The number they read was not a card but an account number for my ACH payments. I stated no do not use that account because it will take days to process. The rep proceeded to process it anyway. I explained I wanted to make a debit payment so its processed today. They said they canceled the ACH and took another debit card that I moved the money to and this payment went through. They apologized for the inconvenience and stated they would submit a request for the fee waiver because of a processing error. This morning when I woke up I had an email stating the waiver was declined and I also saw they took two payments instead of one. One of these payments is unauthorized. They stated it would take 14 days to resolve. So they are charging me fees based on their error and taking unauthorized payments. I spoke to a supervisor who refused to help and hung up on me.

According to 15 USC 1681 ( d ) Consumer Report.

( 1 ) In general.The term consumer report means any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer 's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumers eligibility for ( A ) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes ; ( B ) employment purposes ; or ( C ) any other purpose authorized under section 1681b of this title.

( 2 ) Exclusions.Except as provided in paragraph ( 3 ), the term consumer report does not include ( A ) subject to section 1681s3 of this title, any ( i ) report containing information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report A charge off can only occur when late payments are reported. However, federal law clearly and conspicuously states that reports containing information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report is an exclusion. Do late payments not fall under experiences, which are not supposed to be part of the consumer report? These late payments were reported without authorization and in clear violation of federal law.

A payment may only be treated as late if certain requirements are abided by, one including those of 15 USC 1666 B, labeled under timing of payments. It is stated ; A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

Where is this documentation to validate these late payments that resulted in a charge off? This documentation pursuant of this statute, should have been provided to the credit reporting agencies as well as I, the consumer in order to furnish this information. 

I, the consumer, am stating I received no such documentation to validate the late payments being reported. 

If it is lucid that late payments are an exclusion, what is the basis of this charge-off? There is no justification for this unlawful action. I demand the immediate deletion of this account from my consumer report. 

If this account is not removed within 30 days of your receipt of this letter, I will have grounds to sue. Which will include, but its not limited to ; defamation of character negligent enablement of identity fraud Fair Credit Reporting Acts 15 USC 1681 violations for willful non-compliance and 616 civil liability for willful non-compliance I am fully aware of my consumer rights, and this charge-off was reported in complete disregard of those rights.

Per [ UCC section 1-201 ( 13 ) ] and [ 15 USC 1602 ( g ) ], I am defined as the creditor and my social security number, which is a credit card per [ 15 USC 1602 ( l ) ] and pursuant to section [ 1602 ( n ) ], I am the card holder. The law clearly conveys that banks can not lend there own money as there is no lawful money in circulation and debts can only be paid in gold or silver. Per Article 1, Section 10 of the U.S Constitution, stating that "" No State shall make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts. '' And your banking institution is creating credit based upon the consumers signature, taking consumers promise as obligations of the U.S., taking it to the U.S Treasury and then giving consumers their own credits. So pursuant to [ 15 USC 1691 ( a ) ( 3 ) ], I in good faith exercised my right under the CCPA, only to face unjust discrimination of extension of my own credit, a clear violation of [ 15 USC 1691 ( a ) ].

When I provided American Express with my social security number and name that in turn made it a security and the inquiry appearing on my consumer report is evidence that someone got paid. So I hereby put your organization on notice and would like to inform you that I never gave consent to this reporting. This report being furnished by you on my behalf.

You are subject to criminal liability for violating 15 USC 1691 ( a ) as I have proof that I was discriminated against by American Express due to the response I received. 

Furthermore, because my social security number/credit card was used and I received no benefit, this is proof of fraudulent activity, unauthorized use of a credit card on behalf of American Express .

Your trust indenture, as outlined, appears to involve securities fraud by lack of proper disclosure to consumers as well as other clear violations of sharing my non public information to third parties without my consent, it reads as follows ; The Company periodically securitizes Card Member receivables and loans arising from its card business, including Card Member loans and receivables XXXX, through the transfer of those assets to securitization trusts. The trusts then issue debt securities to third-party investors, collateralized by the transferred assets. 
Card Member receivables are transferred to the American Express Issuance Trust II ( the Charge Trust ). Card Member loans are transferred to the American Express Credit Account Master Trust ( the Lending Trust, collectively the Trusts ). The Trusts are consolidated by American Express Travel Related Services Company , Inc. ( TRS ), which is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. The Trusts are considered VIEs as they have insufficient equity at risk to finance their activities, which are to issue debt securities that are collateralized by the underlying Card Member receivables and loans. Details on the principles of consolidation can be found in the summary of significant accounting policies ( refer to Note 1 ). I would like to point out that this is in fact securities fraud. Proper disclosure is not provided to unsuspecting consumers. 

Our regulators, including regulatory examiners, are increasingly focused on ensuring that our privacy, data protection and information security-related policies and practices are adequate to inform customers of our data collection, use, sharing and/or security practices, to provide them with choices, if required, about how we use and share their information, and to safeguard their personal information in accordance with applicable privacy, data protection and information security laws. 

In the United States, certain of our businesses may be subject to the privacy, disclosure and information security provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) and its implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, the GLBA imposes certain limitations on the ability of a financial institution to share consumers nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties ; requires that a financial institution provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to opt out of the institutions disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties ( with limited exceptions ), and requires the financial institution to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institutions size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institutions activities and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution.

The FCRA was significantly amended by the enactment in 2003 of the FACT Act. The FACT Act requires any company that receives information concerning a consumer from an affiliate, subject to certain exceptions, to permit the consumer to opt out from having that information used to market the companys products to the consumer.

05/03/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a complaint against Chase Bank Credit Card for their unsupportive and unfair treatment following a recent scam incident that I fell victim to. 

Last Monday, I was deceived by a scammer claiming to be an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX if I did not pay for an "" XXXX XXXX XXXX  and a "" XXXX Embassy Bond '' to assist in their investigation. This fake case involved my passport being linked to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. An accomplice posed as a local police officer, corroborating the story. They frightened me into purchasing gift cards as payment for these "" bonds, '' which they claimed would be refunded after I was proven innocent. 

The scammer informed me that I was not allowed to use any online payment methods due to the ongoing investigation and insisted that gift cards were the only acceptable form of payment. While it seems far-fetched now, their contact numbers appeared to be from a XXXX XXXX XXXX and a local police station, and I had traveled to XXXX and XXXX the US through XXXX last year, so I trusted them. They also coerced me into not communicating with anyone or using the internet. 

As a result, I purchased a total of {$11000.00} in gift cards using my Chase, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX cards. I provided the gift card information to the scammers as instructed. The following day, I realized I had been scammed and reported the incident to the police, XXXX, and my banks. XXXX refunded me {$2000.00}, and XXXX XXXX initiated an investigation into the matter. 

However, Chase initially informed me that I was responsible for the debt since I had authorized the transactions. Although I was unhappy with this, I agreed to pay the balance. The next day, a representative from Chase 's security department contacted me, asking questions about my interaction with the scammers. Afterward, they informed me that my account had been closed and that I could request a review for reinstatement within six months. 

I was shocked and requested to speak with a supervisor to understand the situation. The supervisor reiterated that they could close any account for any reason and confirmed that my account closure was permanent. This decision seemed unreasonable, as I had only been a victim of a scam and had planned to pay the outstanding balance myself. 

The closure of my Chase account has made my life even more difficult, as I have billing accounts linked to it. I have always been a responsible cardholder, with no history of late payments. In this scam, I felt that Chase was not on my side and was instead siding with the scammers. They could have warned me about the potential scam when I made 13 consecutive {$500.00} gift card purchases, which is out of character for me based on my credit card history. 

While I understand that it was not their obligation to caution me, their knowledge about scams could have helped me avoid this situation. The most disheartening part is that when I was at my lowest, my bank worsened my situation by closing my account permanently for an unjustifiable reason. 

The most ridiculous part about this whole ordeal is that, even after my account was closed, I continued to receive all sorts of promotional emails from Chase. These promotions included referral bonuses, offers for other products, and auto loan promotions. It's absurd that while the bank deemed me unfit to maintain a basic account, I was still considered a viable candidate for these additional services. This inconsistency only adds to my disappointment and further erodes my trust in Chase. The fact that they closed my account without providing a reasonable explanation, and then proceeded to send me promotional emails, made an already painful situation even worse. 

I am seeking your assistance in addressing this issue and holding Chase accountable for their unfair treatment of a loyal customer who fell victim to a scam.

Instead, it contained a lot of packing material, brown packing paper, and a cheap, used, plastic bathtub. I never received the items I ordered.

I contacted my mail carrier 's corporate number, and was only provided tracking information. The mail agent said the package was uninsured, and they could not help me as it did not qualify for a claim. They suggested I contact my bank. I then called AmEx for assistance. 

An agent helped me open a dispute for the charge the same day ( XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX days after the original charge ). I later found out, after receiving a denial for my initial dispute, that the agent selected the wrong dispute reason. She selected "" not satisfied with quality of goods/services '' instead of "" goods services not received. '' Another agent helped me re-file with the appropriate reason, since I never received the items. I continued to receive XXXX denial letters from Amex, over the last 4 months. Every time I called in, a different agent from a higher escalation team would reassure me that this would be taken care of, as I should not be responsible for goods not received. Each agent promised the dispute would get escalated to a higher tier, and reviewed by a human, instead of a computer. 

I have provided photos of the package and bathtub I received INSTEAD of the baby stroller and gift items I ordered, receipts, unanswered emails to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a police report, and every other piece of documentation I could to verify I never received my goods.

'' I understand that all sales are final, and do not find this reason applicable to my dispute. And as I have told agents several times, I still have no method of contacting the merchant, who has closed down. 

Because AmEx has wasted 4 months of time, between XXXX and XX/XX/2023, intentionally misinformed me of my rights as a consumer, and provided false assurances during several RECORDED phone calls that the charge would be removed, I missed important deadlines and other levels of recourse with filing claims for compensation from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX restructuring firm, insurances, etc. They are holding me liable for charges that I should not be responsible for.

During the 4 hours of being on the phone with various representatives of Wells Fargo Bank the following events took place : XXXX XXXX and XXXX in the fraud department stated to me that the account opened was fraudulent because my phone number ended in XXXX and I could not respond to that number. I stated that on the application of XXXX I did not place XXXX on the account but XXXX. I have not had the first number for over XXXX years. Regardless because they could not send me a code on XXXX the account was fraud. This is the actions of both XXXX and XXXX in Wells Fargo Fraud Department. However, another representative used my email, verified the validity of my new account changed the phone number that had been in the system that actually had been changed nearly 3 years ago to the correct number. XXXX and XXXX did not follow the complete protocol for identifying me as the next representative did. 

The credit card was listed as XXXX XXXX and I had no idea that Wells Fargo was involved until after I had been approved. I was attempting to rent a hotel room at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX while on XXXX XXXX  website. There appeared an offer of a credit of {$150.00} on the statement but it fail to state that the qualifying amount was {$1000.00} in purchases and the XXXX points advertised were not included. Thus this was very deceptive to have seen the offer of {$150.00} statement credit plus earn XXXX points with the calculations of the hotel charge ( XXXX ) minus the {$150.00} statement credit leaving a credit balance of- {$64.00}. Very misleading and challenging to understand. One has no idea that the "" qualifying purchases '' are not the hotel stay charge but {$1000.00}. 

Also the reservation no longer had the option to cancel within 24 hours if one applied for the credit card with XXXX XXXX. 

Upon approval there is a statement, "" Instant credit available for purchases '' {$2000.00} The level 2 representative with Wells Fargo, XXXX, stated to me that only certain individuals who received the link via email could take advantage of the "" instant credit ''. 
If I did not get an email, that I could not qualify. I did not ever get an email. 

After learning all of these discrepancies and the very fact that this credit card is affiliated with Wells Fargo ( I was a participant of the national scam of opening false bank accounts ) I closed the account after about 4 hours on the phone and getting represented who contradicted the statements that were in black and white after opening the account with a line of credit of {$5000.00}.

There were other restrictions to receive the bonus and I asked the bank employee, XXXX XXXX, to go over them in detail with me ( which he did ) on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. According to XXXX, I was eligible for the bonus, all that I needed to do was meet the direct deposit requirements. 

My employer started sending my pay by direct deposit to my new XXXX XXXX Checking starting in XXXX XXXX. It is my understanding that the deposits were made by A.C.H. transfers and were marked as "" salary '' on the transfers. As XXXX had explained, after I had satisfied all of the requirements for the bonus, the bank was supposed to deposit {$300.00} into my account 'within 15 days. '' In XXXX XXXX, I was told by Chase Bank that I had fulfilled all of the requirements and that the money would be deposited soon.

When I did not hear back from them, I called on XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX at which time they told me that they I had completed all of the requirements. No one would explain to me why I had not received the {$300.00}. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a call from XXXX XXXX. The Chase employee, XXXX, asked for a "" pay stub '' from my employer. I did not understand this request. XXXX said that Chase had received all of my direct deposits but did not know if they were from my employer. I asked XXXX why the bank had not asked for clarification earlier when they had received the funds starting in XXXX, and why I had repeatedly been told since XXXX XXXX that I had fulfilled all of the requirements for the bonus. XXXX did not answer. 

XXXX sent me an electronic form, which I was unable to open. I had to call back XXXX XXXX where a different Chase employee explained that XXXX had made a mistake in dealing with my situation. I was then asked to provide a pay stub by an alternative method : by emailing directly to XXXX at XXXX. I send an email with a pay stub attached on XXXX XXXX. 

On XXXX XXXX, I received a call from an XXXX phone number. The Chase employee said that {$300.00} would be credited to my Chase checking account within 7-10 business days, I complained to the employee about the lack of explanation for the delay as well as about the overall lack of transparency of the whole process. The Chase employee said he would look into it, but I never heard back from him. 

On XXXX XXXX, I received a credit of {$300.00} in my checking account. 

At no point during this whole process did Chase adequately explain what was going on, or apologize.

The product we wanted to buy were these sparkly, XXXX XXXX pool balls for a new home we were under contract to buy. The salesman at XXXX  XXXX XXXX named XXXX ( the owner I believe ) said during the purchase he had the balls in stock and would ship them to us. The pool balls were valued at over {$600.00}. Before paying for the pool balls the salesman talked us into buying other items in their store and our total purchase price came to {$2000.00} dollars. Everything seemed fine and we left the store.

On XX/XX/2023 I receive a text from XXXX the pool balls were out of stock and he could instead send us different pool balls valued at {$300.00} or we could wait 30 days. We said no we want the product we ordered, the balls we wanted were twice that price so we'll wait. On XX/XX/2023 I receive another text from XXXX asking if we want "" a game used XXXX XXXX jersey instead of the pool balls or wait for the pool balls. '' We again said we'll wait. On XX/XX/2023 I receive another text from XXXX saying "" I'm not sure when the balls are back in stock, we would like to process a refund of {$290.00} if you would not like to keep waiting. '' Because it felt like I got scammed and was never going to receive the pool balls I disputed the {$2000.00} charge on my credit card and the XXXX  XXXX was added back to my credit card. Within a month of disputing the charge I switched banks because the Wells Fargo branch was no longer convenient to the new home we purchased. My Wells Fargo credit card had a XXXX balance when it was closed. Later I come to find out I lost the dispute because some of the products I received so I could not dispute the full amount. However in my defense there was no option to dispute part of the XXXX XXXX for the product I did not receive. After this happened the {$2000.00} went back on my closed out Wells Fargo Credit card and the merchant told Wells Fargo they would refund me what they owed or send me what I ordered. To this day I never received a refund or the pool balls. Yesterday I discovered the {$2000.00} has been collecting interest and fees for over a year and the balance is now $ XXXX. But the worst part is Wells Fargo made the account a charge off and this has caused my credit score to go from XXXX to XXXX and I have no other derogatory marks on my credit report but this one charge off. This feels like fraud to me because the merchant never sent me the product or refund I was owed and Wells Fargo earned interest on the {$2000.00} dollars ( 30 % of that was the product I never received ). I contacted Wells Fargo to try to settle the matter so I can fix my now damaged credit score. I told them I am fine with paying what I owe but I want to make sure the charge off is removed from my report so my score will go back to where it was before this happened.

I found out that he co-signed for a card in my name. I sent Wells Fargo information proving my ex-husband and I lived at separate addresses at the time he did this and a cash out mortgage 2 years later showing it wasnt on my credit report to pay off at the closing. they are still saying it isnt fraud bc he used our joint checking account to pay the payment like he did for all his debt and bc I own the property where the merchandise was installed. I didnt even live at the property at the time of installation which I also proved. Plus, This is not a secured debt. I proved to Wells Fargo that I didnt know about the debt until after my exhusbands death. I due diligently sent them solid proof of the two different residences and even my digital signature which was not used to sign the contract for the card. My partial name typed out was used to sign the document. They are not using the definition of fraud to determine my case. They are just going by the fact that the merchandise increases the value of my property. Which it does not bc my property is only valued for the land not the building per the tax records. I actually have a negative against the house on my taxes records bc the building is devalued by the tax dept. I can provide proof if they would like the tax statement on my home. I have been contacting Wells Fargo since last year of this issue. It has effected my credit score and cost me thousands of dollars for my husband to have used my information to gain this card. Ive also offered to provide proof that we had no debt in 2019 together not even my mortgage or any debt there after. And Wells Fargo doesnt care about the facts. Ive done everything theyve asked of me only to be denied my fraud claim for the same unproven reasons even after supervisor told me to provide proof I lived at a separate address. No check is signed by me and the first correspondence they had with me about this debt was a month after my husbands death when I was contacting all his creditors about his death and making payments until his estate was set up.

I even proved my husband lied on the application about his income. He has no income at the time and it states he has XXXX XXXX month. And they only have his email address that I didnt even know he had until they sent me a copy of the digitally signed contract he signed through his email. I was forced to settle this debt to keep it from further ruining my debt bc unlike what I was told by the people at Wells Fargo- they were reporting late payments against me.

06/27/24,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Late or other fees,"On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Wells Fargo via their online instant chat messaging system regarding 4 monthly service fees ( {$5.00} each ) that were applied to my Savings Account XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 

Per Wells Fargo 's Monthly Service Fee Summary, below are ways customers can avoid the monthly service fee.

Have any ONE of the following each fee period : - Minimum daily balance of {$300.00} - A daily automatic transfer from a Wells Fargo checking account ( min. {$1.00} ) - Save As You Go transfer from a Wells Fargo checking account ( min. {$1.00} ) - A monthly automatic transfer from a Wells Fargo checking account ( min. {$25.00} ) - Age of primary account owner ( XXXX ) During the months XXXX XXXX, I had pre-scheduled in advance two individual automatic transfers per month to take place the XXXX or XXXX in various amount ranging from $ XXXX {$350.00} each transfer. 

Below are the dates of my scheduled automatic transfers that took place from my checking to savings between XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX - {$300.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$400.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$260.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$260.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$350.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$350.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$350.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$350.00} Based on WF 's fee summary, I believe I had met their waived fee guideline under "" A monthly automatic transfer from a Wells Fargo checking account ( min. {$25.00} ) ''. 
However, WF told me today that because my monthly transfers done manually and not automatically, I did not satisfy the "" A monthly automatic transfer from a Wells Fargo checking account ( min. {$25.00} ) '' rule. Meaning because my scheduled automatic transfers were set up individually on specific dates ( i.e. WF 's definition of setting up my transfers manually ) and not on a reoccurring basis, I did not qualify for the monthly fee waiver. 

My complaint is that nowhere within Wells Fargo 's fee schedule language does it specify that the monthly automatic transfers had to be set up on a REOCCURING BASIS. As a normal person reading the fee summary, Wells Fargos definition of automatic transfer is open to interpretation and therefore is misleading. 

Wells Fargos monthly fee summary does NOT define what their definition of an automatic transfer is. As a customer, I believe that my monthly transfers from my checking to savings, which were pre-scheduled months in advance to with future dates to automatically transfer, and in various amounts well over their {$25.00} min. transfer requirement, meets Wells Fargos guidelines to have the monthly service fee waived.

When I asked Wells Fargos customer service to provide me with the appropriate documents/disclosure with Wells Fargos definition of Automatic Transfer, they could not provide me with it. Instead, they provided the following response : "" I can advise that an automatic transfer, is a banking arrangement where transfers occur between your two ( or more ) accounts on a regular, periodic basis without your further instruction or action. Your manual transfer you set up the day before ( OF NOTE : my transfers were scheduled months in advance and not the day before ) is not considered automatic ... .I understand you would like a definition for "" Automatic '' to be listed somewhere within your account, but since it is the standard definition we use, which I provided, it doesn't seem necessary to have it copied and pasted on your account. However, you can actually perform a definition search online and find it to be the same XXXX and I have given to you during this conversation. Considering the time you have already spent on this issue, I want to respect your time. Did you have any other account issues that I can address while we chat? '' BUT even with Well Fargos online definition of automatic transfer, "" An automatic transfer of funds is a banking arrangement where transfers occur between your two ( or more ) accounts on a regular, periodic basis without your further instruction or action '' - I still believe I met the criteria with my monthly automatic transfers.

For ( 1 ) my automatic monthly transfers were set up months in advance, NOT the day before the transfer date as they claimed.

And ( 2 ), my transfers were pre-scheduled a head of time at x2 transfers per month on a regular/periodic basis and required no further instructions/action on my part.

Therefore my two reasons satisfies their definition : An automatic transfer of funds is a banking arrangement where transfers occur between your two ( or more ) accounts on a regular, periodic basis without your further instruction or action.

At the end, Wells Fargo 's default solution to me was escalating my complaint on to the next department and ending it with the following response : "" A monthly automatic transfer would be a transfer that is created to start a schedule of at least {$25.00} to come out monthly automatically without continuing to log in each month to set it up. Regrettably, the fee decision tool can not be overridden. An adjustment to the account in the amount of {$10.00} has been completed and added to the available balance. '' Again, to the general population, an automatic transfer could be defined as an individual setting up in advance a future-dated transfer of funds to take place - automatically- on a specified date between two accounts with no further action/intervention needed from the individual on the specified date.

Wells Fargo 's Monthly Fee Summary language, "" A monthly automatic transfer from a Wells Fargo checking account ( min. {$25.00} ) '', DOES NOT specifically call out that automatic monthly transfers have to be set up on a reoccurring basis to be eligible for the fee waiver. 

I have requested Wells Fargo to process a full reversal of the service fees to me in the amount of {$20.00}, but their response was that they charged me correctly based on their definition of "" automatic transfer '' and as a courtesy they will only refund me {$10.00}.

I went into an establishment on XX/XX/2022. As is customary I gave my Amex Platinum card and ID to the server for my initial charge. While I was in the bar, they charged 2x {$7700.00} to my card without my knowledge nor consent. My card and ID were given back to me when I left. When I noticed the transactions on my statement I contacted Amex, assuming this was an error. 
Eventually Amex came back to me and said they had copies of the receipts with my ID and card. The signatures on these receipts were not mine. I provided copies of my passport and driving license to show this was a forged signature. At this point Amex moved it from "" disputed '' to "" fraud '' departments. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX from Amex sent one of the transactions to fraud, cancelled my card and sent me a new card. The other transaction stayed in disputed because it was deemed a duplicate transaction. At this point, this had been going on for 5 months, my credit rating had been impacted and so my lawyer wrote a letter dated XXXX XXXX, asking them to expedite this to resolution. On XX/XX/XXXX, the second transaction was also sent to fraud. Around this time, both transactions were reversed and the {$15000.00} credited back to my account. 
I had not received final confirmation so I called and spoke with XXXX on XXXX XXXX at XXXX ET. I was told both have been found in my favor and I would receive a hard copy letter in XXXX days confirming this. 
I did not receive this letter so I wrote a complaint letter on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I received an email on XX/XX/XXXX saying my account was going to be debited {$15000.00}. I called them at XXXX ET and spoke with XXXX XXXX He told me one of the charge disputes had been closed in my favor, the other was still pending but because they are the same case, should be resolved in my favor soon. He told me the email today was incorrect and should never have been sent saying my account would be debited. He told me his supervisor, XXXX will call me within 24 hours. 
XX/XX/XXXX - my account was showing the debit for {$15000.00} so I called and spoke with XXXX. I asked for them to have XXXX or XXXX call me and they had told me the email was incorrect and not to worry. I had still not heard from XXXX nor XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX- had not heard anything so called again and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX, a supervisor who said would handle this and investigage XX/XX/XXXX - voicemail from Amex asking me to file a police report. 

This has been going on for almost a year. 
- my credit rating has been damaged by these charges- this is clearcut fraud - Amex sent me a secure message confirming the case was found in my favor- Amex have told me multiple times on a secure line that one or both cases have been found in my favor - Amex told me to disregard the XX/XX/XXXX email about the debit as it was an error - I still have no idea why the amount was debited after I was told on XX/XX/XXXX that I would receive confirmation of resolution in my favor by mail XXXX days - Amex do not respond to my letters- Amex do not respond to letters from my lawyer - Every time I call them I have to start at the beginning and estimate I have spent over 20 hours on the phone with them about this- They have only recently requested a police report. My lawyer advises me against this since it is almost a year ago. They did not request this previously and I did not file a police report because I always assumed this was an error and Amex found in my favor and reversed the charges - This is over $ XXXX in unauthorized charges.

09/22/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"The creditor as fiduciary reached good faith and fair dealings with agreements crafted by a corporation 's unlawful practice of law with the intent of unlawfully converting the subrogee 's chose-in-action and wilfully and knowingly deprived equitable interest, rights and ownership of the chose-in-acton when requested. The creditor/subrogor and collection agent turned a blind eye to the previous notices of subrogation and equitable interest with the most recent being XXXX. In the process Adverse action was taken by the creditor for attempting to assert my rights, the account was closed when rights to interest and redemption were communicated. One who seeks equity must do equity. Equity will not suffer a wrong without a remedy. Equity follows the law. Principal and Agent are vicariously liable for the other. 

In this era when credit has become one of the instrumentalities of business to which men pay homage, intangible property rights must be considered when conversion is discussed. Stocks, bonds, evidences of debt, debentures, insurance policies, contracts and other choses-in-action play a prominent role in present-day credit economy. Conversion has been defined as a "" wrongful interference over personal property, inconsistent with or in denial of the dominion of the person entitled to possession thereof. It is "" any dealing with the property of another which excludes the owner 's dominion. '' The gist of conversion is the unauthorized assumption of the powers of the true owner. '' A "" chose in action '' is a personal right not reduced to possession. For example, shares of stock, and debts represented by negotiable instruments and savings bankbooks are all choses in action. They are personal property rights, not reducible to immediate tangible possession, not capable of physical delivery ; but recoverable only in an action at equity or law. 

Trover  action will lie for the wrongful conversion of ... bonds, or other securities for the payment of money. This is true with regard to both negotiable and non-negotiable bonds. Even where bonds have been stolen, and a forged indorsement used to obtain new bonds from the corporation, the owner was allowed to recover the bonds from an innocent third party into whose hands the bonds had come. A bond being evidenced by a tangible writing, the courts have no trouble in finding the necessary dominion to allow an action for conversion. '' The underlying debt is immediately converted on the wrongful taking of a negotiable bond, and may be generally assumed to be converted in the case of a non-negotiable bond. 

Trover is a legal action that a property owner can take to recover the value of personal property that was wrongfully taken. The plaintiff must show that they had title or possession of the property at the time the action was filed. The plaintiff can sue the person who first converted the goods, or anyone else to whom the goods were delivered. Trover is different from other remedies for wrongful taking because the plaintiff only recovers the value of the property, not the property itself. The plaintiff can sue the person who first converted the goods, or anyone else to whom the goods were delivered. Today, the tort of conversion has subsumed both trover and detinue, and a plaintiff can request legal relief ( money damages ) or equitable relief ( return of property ). XXXXee, e.g. Burgess v. Small, 117 A.2d 344 ( Me. 1955 ) It has been well settled beyond controversy under the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States, and to issue circulating notes for the money borrowed; when XXXX borrowed We The Peoples private credit, it created a sovereign redemption and subrogation right in We The People and a breach of trust by the subrogors and mortgagees when they clog the We The Peoples right to redeem their collateral borrowed and the securities created on account by indorsement and interfere in commerce. It is against equity for freemen not to have the free disposal of their own property and financial assets.

When it comes to accounts Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code has always applied to the sale of accounts. Revised Article 9 continues this rule in North Carolina 25-9-109 ( a ) ( 3 ). Former Article 9 defined accounts to include payment obligations arising out of only the sale of goods or the provision of services. Under the former law, this left many kinds of payment rights within the definition of general intangible. The sale of these types of payment rights often serves as a financing transaction, but former Article 9 did not apply to these transactions. Revised Article 9 broadens the definition of accounts to include : Payment obligations arising out of the sale, lease or license of all kinds of tangible and intangible personal property ( for example, account will include license fees payable for the use of software ), and Credit card receivables. 

The sale of a payment intangible often functions as a financing transaction. Revised Article 9 brings certainty to these transactions by bringing the sale of a payment intangible into the scope of Article 9. However, to permit financial institutions that sell loan participations to avoid Truth is expressed in the form of an Affidavit. having a UCC-1 financing statement filed against them as debtors, Article 9 provides for the automatic perfection of a security interest created upon the sale of a payment intangible ( but not a security interest in a payment intangible given to secure an obligation ).

NOTICE. EQUITY CONCERNS ITSELF WITH SUBSTANCE AND NOT FORM. Equitable Subrogation is forward-looking rooted in the equity maxim... equity regards done what ought to be done. Equitable subrogation is not founded upon contract, but is the creation of equity, and is enforced solely for accomplishing the end of substantial justice. It is the mode by which equity adopts to compel the ultimate payment of a debt by one who, in justice and good conscience, ought to pay. Equity delights in equality. Equity knows no time. Equity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber on their rights. 

Truth is expressed in the form of an Affidavit. See XXXX. XXXX ; XXXX. XXXX ; XXXX. XXXX ; XXXX. XXXX ; XXXX. XXXX ; XXXX XXXX. An un-rebutted affidavit stands as truth in commerce, equity, admiralty, XXXX XXXX and public policy. XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX ; XXXX. XXXX. Legal maxim : He who does not deny, admits. An un-rebutted affidavit is acted upon as the judgement in commerce, equity, admiralty, XXXX XXXX and public policy. XXXX XXXX. XXXX. Any proceeding in court, tribunal, or arbitration forum consists of a contest, or duel, of commercial affidavits wherein the points remaining unrebutted in the end stand as the truth and the matters to which the judgment of the law is applied. A matter must be expressed to be resolved. XXXX XXXX. XXXX ; XXXX. XXXX ; XXXX. XXXX. Legal maxim : He who fails to assert his rights has none. 

Ultimately the Subrogors actions amount to holding the implied surety in peonage, debt slavery, debt bondage, and involuntary servitude, a severe form of human trafficking in persons. 

I declare under a penalty of perjury the statement is accurate and true to the best of my personal knowledge.

Charging interest and saying if was from a month prior is not right, fair, or being honest. That amount should have been included in the full balance when I selected the option on their website to payoff the full balance. 
They can explain all day long about how their system code works, but that doesn't mean that their system code is correct. 
As I see it, they should be charging interest on the day of the billing cycle ( which they claimed was from XX/XX/XXXX ). So, the interest should have already been included in the pay in full amount. Also, if they are going to provide an option to 'pay in full ', that option should include all interest and principle as of that day. 
Something is not right... I understand what they are saying about what their system code is doing, but again, charging interest on a {$.00} balance or balance prior to the payoff is wrong.

01/20/23,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"I have a FHA loan through Wells Fargo. I've requested a couple of deferments during a separation, XXXX and during COVID XXXX & XXXX. I was understood the agreement offered by the home preservation team with Wells Fargo defer my payment of put to the end/back of my loan. Instead the payments that were supposed to be added to the back of my loan were added as a second Mortgage with a different servicer. I feel like I mislead even when asking several times if it cause me to have a second Mortage and was told no. This Covid-19 Crisis Plan went through Wells Fargo and XXXX ( servicer I just learned about ). I applied for a HELOC and was made aware through the title search. The payoff never showed that I owed this large amount. I was told I was getting a loan modification with a lower interest rate. I learned through XXXX that I had a 2nd mortgage against my home for greater than {$45000.00}, which I had to pay in order to get the HELOC to do repair to my home. The payoff with Wells Fargo is currently {$140000.00}. I purchased my home for {$200000.00} 11 years ago and never missed a payment until I was told I had to miss the payment in order to qualify for assistance during COVID. How could this be? Now I'm paying {$45000.00} 2nd mortgage off through a HELOC ( not being able to complete all my home repairs and pay other debts and my current mortgage with Wells Fargo. I'm back at square one. I believe Wells Fargo has overcharged me and the partial claims amount exceed the actual amount of payments as well as blatantly mislead me about the Covid assistance, loan modification. I don't have the equity I thought I had to complete home repairs and pay debts I am deeply in- having to pay a 2nd mortgage is causing me a greater hardship. I owe more now from carrying a 2nd mortage of money they stole from me on top of my paying my own taxes and homeowners insurance shortages- my mortgage payment has increased due to the escrow shortage. I feel deceived by Wells Fargo with this supposedly forbarence, loan modification to a actual excessive 2nd mortgage on my home with interest and that is my money. I had been follwing this class action since the beginning and have been asking to be listed amongst the other injured parties and I had heard nothing back from the Class Action Lawsuit team- can you please assist me? I need help with getting a return of my funds. if your willing to help some people but not willing to add me. I am still underwater with my home and and in more debt with my attempt to use my home equity and having to pay {$45000.00}. I appreciate any and all help I can get with regards to this matter. Thank you for you assistance and consideration.

09/19/23,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"I am writing to request the assistance of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) in resolving a matter concerning my credit report. I believe that JPMorgan Chase Bank ( hereinafter referred to as "" JPMCB '' ) has inaccurately reported information about my credit history, specifically regarding a credit card debt. I have diligently followed the proper dispute procedures with JPMCB to address this issue, but unfortunately, I have not received satisfactory resolution. 

I have previously sent XXXX formal dispute letters to JPMCB, dated XX/XX/2023 and XX/XX/2023 respectively, regarding credit card accounts that they claim I opened. In these letters, I requested that JPMCB provide documented proof that the debt is indeed mine, including a valid signature as evidence of my agreement to the debt 's terms. To my disappointment, JPMCB has not provided any verifiable evidence confirming my liability for this debt. 

In response to my second dispute letter, JPMCB sent me XXXX separate statement letters ( packets ), each purportedly showing charges related to this disputed debt. However, these statements lack proper verification or substantiation to establish that the accounts pertaining to # XXXX and # XXXX are in fact mine. It is noteworthy that the third account, also reported as owing, bearing account number # XXXX, has not been accompanied by any corresponding statement. All three of these accounts, as delineated, are presently documented on my credit report. 

I firmly believe that it is my right to have accurate and verifiable information on my credit report. The inaccuracies reported by JPMCB have the potential to adversely impact my financial well-being and future creditworthiness. Therefore, I kindly request that the CFPB investigate this matter and facilitate a resolution in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and other applicable regulations. 

Furthermore, in accordance with the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I request that JPMorgan Chase Bank ( JPMCB ) furnish clear and unequivocal evidence that conclusively demonstrates my initiation of the credit line in question as the primary account holder, and not as a authorized user. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, a signed and executed credit agreement, account opening documentation, or any legally binding contract establishing my independent liability for the debt in question. 

The accuracy and completeness of the reported credit information are of paramount importance in ensuring compliance with federal regulations, including the FCRA, which underscores the necessity for JPMCB to substantiate the authenticity of my indebtedness beyond any reasonable doubt. 

I trust that JPMCB, as a responsible creditor, will promptly provide the requisite documentation to clarify my status as the primary account holder and assist in resolving this matter expeditiously. Failure to furnish such evidence may be construed as a violation of my rights under federal law and could warrant further legal action to rectify these inaccuracies. 

I have attached copies of my dispute letters to JPMCB and one-page each from the statement letters they provided in response, as well as a copy of my current credit report reflecting the discrepancies I have outlined. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your assistance in resolving this dispute. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this important issue.

Business Phone # ( XXXX ) XXXX cell phone ( XXXX ) XXXX Address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NC XXXX I had an employee by the name of XXXX XXXX that deposited another employee 's 2 checks into her Wells Fargo account on XX/XX/2022. The account number is XXXX. The other employee 's name, who the check was written to is XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, simultaneously, deposited another person 's check ( I'll refer to him as "" person # 3 '' since I don't remember his name ... from another business that same day. They are all very good friends and were roommates at the time. They are all international students that are currently not in the country but I do still interact with them -- mostly due to what I'm in the middle of explaining. 

Wells Fargo kicked out the deposit of the check from "" person # 3 '' and closed XXXX 's account. It's my understanding that they were supposed to do that to our checks ( written to XXXX XXXX. The status of my 2 checks was left in limbo... They maintained the money from the third party deposit that they were not supposed to keep. 

A few days later the girls came to me and asked me if I could cash their checks. I did without issue. They failed to tell me that they had already deposited them and that they couldn't get to the money. After cashing the checks and depositing them into the XXXX XXXX -- the checks bounced back. 

This started a huge mess. After forcibly closing the account, Wells Fargo moved the money in the amount of {$2600.00} to a loss prevention account. I then brought XXXX to the local branch twice to sort everything out. Everyone that I have worked with has not been able to help me or XXXX. We spent hours in person, on the phone and via emails. I have about 100 pages of paperwork on this that ranges from the copies of the checks from XXXX XXXX, the two differing bank deposits, the Viewpoint transaction details, the full printout of XXXX XXXX 's account along with her social, DOB and much, much more... 

The girls have received the money off of their checks and the business is currently still trying to get the {$2600.00} back. I've had our bank, XXXX XXXX, try twice to retrieve the funds. We have lodged 2 requests for the funds to be returned. Each time we are put into a 1 to 2 month cycling Que (? ) where a response is promised at the end but no one has ever reached out either time. We have never received an explanation, answer or been directed on how to handle this going forward. I'm mired in no-man 's land with the different departments in Wells Fargo not being able to communicate with each other about anything to get me heading towards a resolution. I have about 60 man hours invested in this -- if not way more. No one from Wells Fargo wishes to help either myself, XXXX or XXXX. They shut me down because I'm not on the account. They shut XXXX down because she's not on the check. They won't respond to XXXX because she doesn't/did n't have an account with them. They will not talk with the officers of my bank. They will not respond when promised. I'm now being told that MAYBE the money has been sent to the state in one of the girls ' names for uncollected/unclaimed money because they, Wells Fargo , say that they won't hold money like this... but they aren't sure exactly where the money was moved to as they can not track its whereabouts. I repeat, they can not say where the money is. I was, however, told that after 2 months they like to forward it to unclaimed $ in whatever state. I went to the UNCLAIMED MONIES site for North Carolina and their names did not "" ping ''. 

I can get the girls to provide any assistance to remedy this as they are not thieves. I have already shown that I will do anything asked to get this handled. I just need some sort of internal communication from Wells Fargo with instructions on how to proceed in order to rectify this. I have any documentation you may request on this.

03/05/24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Back in XXXX I was coming off of a divorce. My now ex-wife was in charge of all credit cards after the proceedings. There was an account opened in my name that I was unaware of at the time, a JPMCB card. My ex wife also denies this cards existence. It appeared as a charge off in my credit report in early XXXX for one month and then vanished but only after my credit suffered again. My credit was already in shambles from the divorce so I assumed the mistake had been corrected or my ex wife had kept her end of the agreement and paid it, if it was to be one of hers. From this day in XXXX on, it was not a problem. I was able to rebuild my credit profile for XXXX years. Going from a low XXXX credit score to mid XXXX. with hard work and constantly staying on top of my credit. As supporting documents will show. Now, fast forward until XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX years after the initial late payments and charge off had already hit my credit. I had applied for a Rewards ( points ) credit card to further my credit journey, with a company i already have a card with. I had been getting pre approval letters constantly and thought it to be a good time to apply. The approval process to an extremely long time until I received a denial letter in the mail with the reasoning being, Charge-Off, multiple late payments. So i went and logged in to my credit profile and sure enough, this company has reported to my credit profile a charge off for a 2nd time and continuously report a being 90 days late even after the account has been closed for 5 years. My credit took another XXXX point hit wiping out all my hard work over the last 5 years. I immediately filed a dispute with experian at first, claiming I do not have any knowledge of the account, they came back within days telling me "" the account had been verified '' and that was it. So then I started another dispute also with them providing more detail. They came back with the same results, "" the account has been verified ''. At this point, im at a loss. ok, the account has been verified, what does that mean and are they allowed to report to my credit profile like that and ruin me again after not reporting for 5 years? How is that fair? So I go for broke and file one last dispute. this time, with all XXXX Credit Bureaus as well as the creditor. I send in, my credit reports showing where it was charged off in XXXX and closed in XXXX. I send in my divorce papers. I sent screenshots that show, where nothing had been reported and where I been able to open new accounts over the years and then it crashed again once they reported it again for the 2nd time and continue to report. XXXX responded within 3 days of me filing the dispute "" The account has been verified '', it is like they didn't even read the dispute letter. XXXX, XXXX and JPMCB all respond this past week, XXXX. All the same. Verifying the account and changing some dates, meanwhile my credit score too another XXXX point hit last monday from the reporting of the same account because they are reporting monthly 90 day late payments since last XXXX. Yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX i called chase bank who is the original account holder and still holds the account, it has not been sold to a collection agency. I was finally able to speak to a man Named XXXX from XXXX I know, horrible information keeping, i was so upset and couldn't think straight. I do not have an account number or credit card number associated so I could not give that to him to find the account because again, I have no knowledge of this account. But he found it under my social. He once again, "" verified the account '' it seems that is all anyone wants to do. I asked him why it was reported in XXXX and then vanished and then all of a sudden it is now being reported again? he said "" I do not know, chase when in and deleted some things and then re added them '' that was the only answer I could get. I then offered to pay the account in full to resolve the issue and was told that "" Chase does not do that and they wish me well in my next endeavors '' but was also informed that it will fall off of my credit in XXXX of XXXX, so a little over a year from now. That is where the conversation ended. I offered to pay a debt that I have no knowledge off to fix my credit again.. and was told that i have to just wait it out. After years of hard work to build my profile back up. How is that fair credit reporting? I understand if it has to stay on your report once it has been reported, but to be able to rebuild and then have them report on the same charge off a 2nd time does not seem like fair credit reporting. I am asking for help in this matter with stopping them in this unfair reporting and restoring my credit to where it was last fall before they reported this again on me. XXXX says the effects of a charge off are virtually gone after year 5 event though the record stays on your account for 7 years. They Re-Reported on the 6th year after the account was closed and charged off and I have been working to rebuild. I do not understand why the credit agencies think this is ok as well.

06/09/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Denied request to lower payments,First this isn't new I just never reported it prior and I saw a new settlement with Wells Fargo over this sort of thing so I decided to report what they did to me now. My name is XXXX XXXX and my address during the loan was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NC XXXX. They should be able to find my loan based off of that. My spouse was a coborrower on that loan as well his name is XXXX XXXX. This incident occured in XXXX or XXXX i believe. He had just started a new job and we were waiting on his first pay check. Our car payment was behind do to this issue. We were roughly 4 years into our 6 year loan id guess.The transmission had already dropped out so the car was nothing more than a yard onmanent but we didnt want bad credit so we were doing our best to keep it up. At that time we had 2 payments due. I knew we were allowed 3 deferals over the life of the loan and we had only used 1 of them at that point. I explained this to my spouse and i told him to call and ask them to go ahead and activate our remaining 2 deferments. So he called in and explained to them all I've stated here and requested that they activate our remaining 2 deferments we still had which would put us current with a new payment about to be due. They agreed on the phone that day to activate them for us. Then we told them when his first payday was with his new job and that we'd pay the next payment just coming due at that time. He said he noted that in the account and he put in for our deferments as well. When XXXX got paid his employer didn't let him off that day till after bank hours had closed so he wasn't able to cash his check. So we had no choice but to wait till the following business day to go into the bank the check was written from and cash it. We cashed it the followimg business day then I called them to make that paymrnt. It was Monday afternoon and I explained I was calling to make that payment we had told them we'd make the prior Friday. The rep came to the phone and informed me that they couldn't take my payment because earlier that morning they put in for a repossession of the car. I said no you must be mistaken you couldn't have done that becauae this is the only payment due on the account. I then explained we activated our 2 remaining deferment and they agreed to it so this can't be. He came back to the line after a long pause and told me that it is for sure in repossession status as of that morning and from what he can tell the 2 deferments were contingent upon us keeping our promise to pay on that prior Friday. I told him we weren't told that we were told it was done already and when we told them his first pay it was to give them a ball park as to when they could expect the next payment we weren't aware we were setting it in stone because had the 2 deferments been granted as we were informed was the case then that payment was barely even due and wasn't past it's grace period. I said therefor i had no reason to think i was setting that in stone I thought i was giving them a general idea nothing more and i most certainly wasnt told my deferments were on the line if the payment wasnt in that Friday 's its quite the opposite i thought that was already set in stone that is what the rep lead me to believe was the case. So i said i told him we needed him to fix this now and that obviously never happened bevause im writing this now ... I never reported this back then but I decided to do so now since I read an article about similar customer abuse as to what we encountered with them ourselves.

I didn't take a loan out with this nefarious institution, and I feel that customers should have a say in who we are going to be obligated to do business with for 30 years, especially when it is about something as intimate as a mortgage. This company has no understanding about doing business in rural spaces. We don't have reliable internet in our region because we are unserved by providers due to the rural nature and small number of households, yet in still Freedom tries to force people to handle all issues on the internet, pertaining to their mortgages. Freedom will not accept debit cards, and only uses routing and account numbers which increases the likelihood of a mistake, because of the populations of rural spaces and the lack of check usage, bank branches, and education. I did not sign up for this, the original company I had a mortgage with took debit cards and I didn't have to go online for anything and now my credit has taken a significant hit because of these actions of Freedom Mortgage, who have more resources than I do. 

What legal steps can I take. 

I know you all have already won lawsuits against this company for repeat violations, how can I start investigating with other borrowers to see if there are common instances happening to them, with this Freedom Mortgage? 

I know the CFPB doesn't need this article, but this is a large corporation I am up against and Freedom will not listen, and I am getting disparate as they are just ruining my credit. Please provide directions, before my entire life is ruin by me wanting a house and the lender selling that mortgage to Freedom Mortgage.

The credit card that was to be honored in said transaction is the Social Security Card, specifically the account numbers placed on the electronic credit application.

Please escalate this complaint because Wells Fargo is doing the same thing they did to me which caused a problem with my loan and later they refused to modify my loan. They NEVER offered me a modification. Again, I have phone recordings from their employees saying they didnt understand why WF didnt put me in a HAMP modification. The employees also state that WF tried to offer me something that was NOT a modification. When I talked to several employees at headquarters, they couldnt believe WF tried to wrap their error into a package. The deal they offered was to increase the amount I owed without correcting their mistake, increase my monthly payments by {$400.00} a month and pay {$3000.00} down. I think I mentioned that my husband died, I was a widow with a XXXX XXXX XXXX child and I didnt have any extra money and is the reason I was trying to get a modification. I was trying to modify my loan to LOWER my payments NOT INCREASE them and keep my son and I in our home. I NEVER signed any papers or made any agreements with WF. I can prove it through LOTS of recordings. Please have someone OTHER than WF Representatives to contact me please. Then I will provide EVERYTHING I have to anyone but WF. THEY HAVE NEVER TRIED TO HELP ME OR ANYONE ELSE. Based on how WF handles things, its clear that they discriminate against minorities. 


REPOST : I was one of the customers of Wells Fargo who was denied a HAMP modification. I have not received anything from Wells Fargo. Because I lost my home it would probably be hard for anyone to reach me. Actually, I should have been one of the first people WF reached out to because I fought hard and long to get them to correct my account with excessive fees, etc. Immediately after my husband died, I found out that Wells Fargo messed up my loan by creating an escrow account claiming I owed money for my taxes which had been paid. Also, when I carefully audited my account I found they had added a bunch of unnecessary fees. Wells Fargo double paid the taxes on my home. I contacted each taxing authority to sort things out and get proof, which I sent to Wells Fargo. Even after Wells Fargo received the proof and each taxing authority REIMBURSED them, WF still did not remove or correct the error on my account. Later I applied for a HAMP modification which I was MORE than qualified/eligible to receive and was turned down more than nine ( 9 ) times. I worked with the people that were setup to help with modifications, I even paid people to modify my loan and each time I was denied. No one could understand why I wasn't getting approved. My attorney spoke with WF attorneys and WF 's attorney 's didn't understand why I wasn't being approved. Due to my persistence, at one point my account was handled by executive offices and even WF 's employees could not understand why I wasn't being approved. My home ended up in foreclosure several times and I even filed a lawsuit against Well Fargo and all their servicing companies. I wrote to Washington begging for help! After fighting to keep my home for years, I lost it in 2015 and became homeless. I was separated from my son and basically lived on the streets with my 2 little dogs. By the grace of GOD my son was able to stay with some friends of his until he graduated high school and went to college in XXXX XXXX. I still have all of my documentation where I filed lawsuits against Wells Fargo and if you XXXX me on line, you can find copies of it. I eventually had to give up the fight because I couldn't afford counsel, didn't have the knowledge or expertise to fight against WF 's team of lawyers and lost my home where I didn't have access to computers, printers or anything else needed to fight. The shocking and amazing part of my story is that I was able to help 20 people to modify their loans and get approved for a HAMP modification... ..but couldn't get mine approved. The people I helped were in a worse situation than I was ... .but, they still got approved.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NC,27519,None,Consent provided,Web,06/02/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7062579

05/23/24,Credit card,Store credit card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"On XX/XX/XXXX I opened my XXXX XXXX account to purchase phones. At the time I scheduled the automated monthly payment to come out of my account automatically and those payment were made automatically through XX/XX/XXXX. At the time the account stayed active just like any other credit card I have, with no balance and I did not initiate an automatic pay feature cancellation. When I purchased my new device on XX/XX/XXXX, I was asked if I already had a XXXXXXXX XXXX account, which I did and had available credit to buy the new phones. I provided the information and at checkout it stated the monthly payment amounts, I agreed to the charge, and I received my phone. 

Up until XX/XX/XXXX, I thought that my account was being automatically drafted for the monthly payments that XXXX XXXX disclosed when I purchased my phone. They made it sound like, if I already had an account, then nothing would change. Like I shared earlier on this letter, I never changed any feature on my account, so automatic payment was my preferred method of payment, I didn't even have access to my online account. However, I opened a letter from TD Bank, who seems to be the credit issuer for this card, stating that my account was going to be sent to collections. Confused, I called the collections number, and asked my husband to help me with this situation. Through that discussion, we learned that TD Bank had cancelled their auto-pay feature on my account and when I purchased the new phones, despite what I was made to believe when I purchased my new phones, my account was not been automatically paid. The agent stated that there were letters sent to me but the only letter I received was the one I opened and resulted on the phone call I was making to them to resolve the situation. I explained that I opened the TD Bank letter because I found it odd that I kept getting so many of them - I have a TD Bank auto loan and I never open those because my bank sends the payment directly to them through e-bill. But now I was getting more than just 1 a month, so I decided to open it. Afterall, if anything, I would have been expecting a XXXX XXXX letter rather than a TD Bank one, and even then I probably would have thrown it in the trash because my account was setup with auto-pay... or so I thought. 

They asked if I looked at the payments coming out of my account, and I explained that there are 37 payments that come out of my bank account on a monthly basis, and that there is always a balance available to make those payments, so I don't keep track of that. Additionally, most creditors will attempt to collect the debt past the due date by giving me a call, but no one called. It's as if they expected to reach me by sending off-brand letters that I thought were just car loan statements. Additionally, they shared that there were $ XXXX in late fees that the collector could only waive {$40.00}, recommended I made the payment to bring the account current to then call next day to a different number, talk to customer service to see if they would waive more. Although that sounded strange, I had no other choice. The agent helped me get access to my account, then recommended I made the payment with him or online. I asked if I made the payment online if he'd be able to waive the {$40.00}, and he stated that he wouldn't unless he saw the payment posted. I asked if he could just take care of it with me on the phone and then waive the payment- he said he could do that. Why wouldn't just tell me he could waive it if I made the payment on the phone is beyond me - someone should listen to the whole phone call, it is quite eye opening. 

Once I made my payment, my husband informed him that we would go in and schedule the automatic payment shortly after the call. He advised not to do that, since their system was at risk of not being able to processing both the payment he was taking over the phone and the automatic payment scheduling. My husband then highlighted to him that it was insane that the system would XXXXXXXX XXXX something like that, although he wasn't surprised given the fact that the system also cancels the automatic payment as soon as the balance is setup which is contrary to the industry standard. He emphasized that the fact that their processes deviated from what consumers generally experience from credit card companies was causing financial harm to other customers- such as me - where consumers believe they are set to use auto-pay technologies to pay their credit card accounts, but how the process is designed and how the system handles user settings is so vastly different that consumers pay the price. The collector agent stated that he was not surprised since TD Bank technology was in fact very bad and it was not the first time he had seen issues with their processes and technology. 

I now have or will have derogatory marks on my credit report - despite many years of not missing 1 payment and having pristine credit. And there are still $ XXXX in late fees sitting in my account, but as a good citizen and responsible consumer, I went ahead and waited until today to re-setup the auto-pay they unilaterally cancelled on my account. I am willing and able to pay, I have not experienced a financial hardship and all of this could have been prevented if I wasn't deceived to think that the payments would be automatically drafted as a result of completing the purchase, nor that a credit card company would unilaterally cancel the auto-pay on an active account.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,NC,XXXXX,None,Consent provided,Web,05/23/24,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,9075780

02/02/23,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Problem making or receiving payments,"I have had MULITPLE problems with Wells Fargo. I have been a customer since XXXX. The most recent problem began at the beginning of XXXX, XXXX. I had opened a new business checking account with another online company. I linked my Wells Fargo savings account with this online business account at another bank. Test deposits were confirmed by Wells Fargo. When I tried to transfer money out of WF into the new online account, I kept getting an error message ( transfer was denied to "" protect '' my account ). I noticed the transfer limits were much lower than the amount allowed to another online bank account I had. So I tried the lower amount. I received a call from WF fraud protection. I confirmed all of my info with that person. She said I should now be clear to make the transfer up to my low limit. She said this was often done with new linked accounts, but that I should not have any future issues with ACH transfers to that account. She said it could take an hour. I tried XXXX hours later. Would not work. I tried the next day. Would not work. 

Over the course of the next XXXX weeks, I spoke with more than XXXX PEOPLE at Wells Fargo, from lower level reps to supervisors, to XXXX different people at the "" customer advocacy office '' for WF, who eventually recommended filing a complaint on my behalf to the "" LineofBusinessExecutiveOffice ''. I filed more complaints because no one got back to me. I spoke with supervisors who spoke with the "" technical '' department, and no one could figure out why I could not transfer any money to my business checking account. NO ONE at Wells Fargo, more than XXXX people including several higher ups could tell me why I could not transfer my own money to my own business checking account. I was able to transfer {$250.00} eventually ( the limits are $ XXXX and $ XXXX ). 

I have not been able to transfer a single dollar more than that now for over a month. "" XXXX XXXX '' from "" XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX '' finally replied after a couple of weeks. She had left a voicemail after I missed her call. I called right back and left her a voicemail to call me again. She did not. A week later, I called and had to speak with someone else to try and reach her. She finally replied after a week. She could not figure out the problem. She said she needed to look into it. So another week passed, and she left another voicemail. I called her back the same day and left her a voicemail saying to please call me back. I also replied to her email in the WF secure messaging saying I left her a voicemail and to please call me back. This was a week ago now. "" XXXX '' has refused to reach out to me again. Additionally, she was not professional and was a bit rude the time I did talk to her, often speaking over me. She was pretty dismissive of the whole issue. But now, no one will reply back to me, and no one can solve the problem. The last email I got from XXXX "" XXXX '' said I should remove the business account and try again... to just start over. 

The "" customer service '' at Wells Fargo has been horrendous. Not a single person has been able to tell me why I can not transfer my own money to my own, linked business checking account. It's been over a month now. And the "" top level '' customer complaint office has failed to reply back to me now after a week, after I have left a direct voicemail on the rep 's direct line a week ago and also replied to her email a week ago. 

I am trying to run a new startup business, and I can not send another single dollar to fund my business checking account from my WF account. And the fact that the highest levels of Wells Fargo "" customer service '' refuse to reply to me makes it all even worse - exponentially. 

I don't think Wells Fargo values my business with them after 14 years. I have wasted roughly XXXX hours of my time with this latest issue alone ( phone conversations with over XXXX people, being on hold, writing emails, filing complaints, etc., and it has cost me an ENORMOUS amount of frustration. WF is hindering my ability to run my business. And they simply say "" you can try again '' in their latest attempt to resolve this.

This is my second attempt for Chase and XXXX to correct my credit report regarding a late payment. As part of this complaint, I have attached a sworn affidavit, and I expect Chase and the Credit bureaus to do the same as part of their investigation. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I became aware of a need to make a payment on the above account. After attempting to make payments, the payments were not made. In XX/XX/XXXX, I made a credit to the above account of {$420.00}. After making this payment I called Chase XXXXredit services, and they told me that the payment of {$420.00} would not be accepted for payment towards my account. They also said that if I could make a payment of at least {$200.00}, they would make sure that I would not get a late payment. They told me to make the payment before a certain date, which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. After this, several late fees, interest charges, and other fees were added to my account and now I have a late payment on my credit report with the credit bureaus. 
Chase claims that all conversations are recorded when calling, so if a serious investigation was done by Chase and the credit bureaus, they would know what I was told to do to avoid a late payment and I did it. But Chase and the credit bureaus are still claiming that I have a late payment.

After I was told by Chase credit services, as a consumer, that if I did such and such I would not be charged with a late payment, only for Chase to do exactly that is misleading me as a consumer and their own investigations into my claim is misleading because they never mention the phone call in which they said I would not have a late payment.

01/02/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"To whom it may concern, In the month of XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Freedom Mortgage explaining that my mortgage payment would increase due to a mortgage insurance increase. I was told by the Freedom Mortgage representative that this increase was requested in the month of XXXX for a {$190.00} increase that had been paid out until XXXX when I was finally made aware of this. Totaling a little under {$1200.00}. I then contacted XXXX my mortgage insurance company, to find out why I had not been informed of this increase. The XXXX customer service representative apologized and stated that they thought that I had received a letter informing me of this increase. That phone call took place on or about XX/XX/XXXX a couple of days before my birthday the XXXX of XXXX. In that same week I hired a different mortgage insurance provider and notified Freedom Mortgage of this change. I also informed the Freedom Mortgage representative that as soon I received the check from XXXX  that I would forward that check to Freedom Mortgage and I requested at that time that a recalculation of my escrow account be done. I received the check from XXXX  on or about the XXXX of XXXX, XXXX and I mailed the check from XXXX as I received the check to Freedom Mortgage. I had not heard anything from Freedom Mortgage for about three weeks. So, on or about XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Freedom Mortgage to find out if they had received the check that I had mailed to them and if they had done the recalculation of my account. The Freedom Mortgage representative stated that they had not received my check. Which made no sense to me. So, I called XXXX about the check. XXXX explained that my check was cashed by Freedom Mortgage on XXXX XXXX and sent me pictures of the cashed check. I again called Freedom Mortgage back and asked to speak with a supervisor. I informed her of what I had found out and she was able to locate my check. She explained that Freedom Mortgage had applied the check from XXXX XXXX XXXX written on the check to interest of my loan. The supervisor requested to have that check reapplied to my escrow account and requested a recalculation of my account again. During the months of XXXX and XXXX of XXXX, I continued to pay {$1100.00} on time as I have since Freedom Mortgage purchased my loan back in XXXX of XXXX. After the recalculation on or about XX/XX/XXXX, I found that the Insurance increase really had nothing to do with my monthly mortgage increase as Freedom Mortgage first alleged. The representative explained that there was an escrow deficit since Freedom Mortgage took over my loan back in XXXX of XXXX. Clearly Freedom Mortgage had not done its due diligence in the entire eleven months of purchasing my loan and allowed this imbalance to grow for the entire 11 months. The representative explained that after the recalculation my new payment would be {$1200.00} and in the month of XXXX and XXXX of XXXX, I paid the {$1200.00}. Freedom Mortgage clearly is not interested in facts. I have received notices that I am enclosing during the recalculation period. Before the recalculation I was requested to pay by Freedom Mortgage {$1300.00}, {$1200.00}, and {$1200.00} as my new monthly payment. It appears that after doing absolutely nothing to rectify this unmanaged mess that Freedom Mortgage single handedly created. Freedom Mortgage is now in a rush to correct the mismanagement of my account. I informed Freedom Mortgage that I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and that my fuel expense weekly was in excess of XXXX dollars for fuel alone. I made it clear that there was no way I could afford {$1300.00} a month especially while there was a recalculation request in process and a check was on its way from my old insurance company. It absolutely makes no sense to pull fictitious numbers out the air all the while knowing that a recalculation would be done shortly to effectively have factual numbers going forward. Please be advised that this is the second letter that I am writing to the Consumer Financial Protection Agency about Freedom Mortgage in less than 30 days. My first letter complained about this same escrow issue and XXXX Mortgages response had nothing to do with my complaint that I wrote to you. Freedom Mortgage response stated that the correspondence sent to the credit bureaus was accurate and that my account was in good standing which is what I received in XXXX of XXXX. I also received in the month of XXXX a notice that my credit score had dropped about 100 points due to the allegation of being thirty days late in XXXX and XXXX of XXXX to Freedom Mortgage. XXXX and XXXX come before XXXX, so I would have to believe that Freedom Mortgage intentionally lied to me and the XXXX. This was a malicious intentional covert act intended to stop me from departing from this incompetent and inept Mortgage company known as Freedom Mortgage. In the month of XX/XX/XXXX, I had contacted 5 Refinance companies regarding cashout options and transferring my loan to a different lender. My credit scores were XXXX, XXXX and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, and 3 days later I was notified that my scores had dropped about 100 points due to Freedom Mortgage notifying the Credit Bureaus that I was 30 days late on my mortgage payment. This is an outrageous lie perpetrated by Freedom Mortgage. I am including my monthly mortgage payment as it deducted from my bank. It is clear that Freedom Mortgage is desperate to keep clients whom want nothing to do with such horrendous bookkeeping and their pathetic retaliation practices. In closing, Freedom Mortgage offers customer a shortage repayment faxs sheet. The first entry is ( am I required to pay my shortage in a lumpsum? ) Freedom Mortgage response is ( no the customer may elect to do so at your own discretion. ) This being the case then why is Freedom Mortgage forcing me to pay {$1300.00} when I have already informed them that I can not afford to pay that much each month even though I have increased my payment from {$1100.00} to {$1200.00} already. The shortage repayment form from Freedom Mortgage clearly states that a customer can pay their escrow shortage at their own discretion. Either this is a practice of deception or it is intentional sabotage directed towards a first-time home buyer. There is no good reason why Freedom Mortgage would contact the credit bureaus all the while knowing that I have never ever been late EVER!!!",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Freedom Mortgage Company,NC,27360,None,Consent provided,Web,01/02/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6387746

The rep who answered told my computer had been hacked and my financial information was compromised. She asked me for the Customer Service telephone number on the back of my debit card and said she would add them on the line for me.

The new person identified himself as a XXXX XXXX  employee who was part of a special group assigned to work fraudulent activity for XXXX. He told me my bank accounts had been compromised by the computer hack and I needed to act immediately to avoid loss. He literally terrified me to the point I could not think clearly. He instructed me to withdraw all my funds from all my bank accounts and to also withdraw all the cash advances available from all my credit cards. 
He said the hacking might well be the work of a bank employee, so I was to tell absolutely no one why I was withdrawing the cash. 
Since I believed he was a bank employee, I did as I was instructed, withdrawing {$15000.00} in cash from my XXXX  account, {$3000.00} in cash from my XXXX  account and {$10000.00} in cash advances from my credit cards. 
He then instructed me to deposit the cash into a XXXX ATM. 
They would hold the money safely for me until my accounts at the banks were secured. The money would then be transferred back into my accounts. 
He then instructed me to purchase XXXX {$500.00} gift cards using my credit cards and provide him the PIN numbers on the back. I did so.

I said NO - especially since I was speaking with him on the phone and not buying anything. He said he had stopped that charge but was not sure he could reverse the {$990.00} cash withdrawal even though it had just happened. After a couple of weeks the bank informed me that they could not/would not return the {$990.00} to my account because it was a "" legitimate '' withdrawal. I questioned how that could be when I was on the phone while this crime was being committed. The banks eventual rationalization was - "" a trusted device was used by the perpetrator '' and since I could not prove that was NOT me is must be me. I told them that is what the justice calls fraud. I have spent hours, days on the phone with the bank, bank vice president, service persons pleading my case. I have filed 5 different complaint issues, been "" recorded '' on the phone with at least 7 persons affiliated with the fraud division ALL have agreed with me and only the supervisor has denied my pleas. Even a loan officer and the bank Vice President have filed complaints on my behalf and all have been denied. Even one of the complaint persons ( ALL on recorded lines ) I told my story gave me advice on how to re-file and re-word the issue to get satisfaction. They say the trusted device had a phone number ending in XXXX. I assume now that this fraud was perpetrated a hacker that got into me computer and opened up a XXXX account. This employee said he recognized the pattern of opening up a XXXX account waiting two months then making a withdrawal. He said to explain this to XXXX XXXX the person hearing and denying my case. He said this was a common way to take out money, not to try and take out the money immediately but wait a while. I told them I did not fraudulently take {$990.00} from my own account. How would I benefit from creating a fraud against myself. Strangely enough this same bank hired me 15 years ago when it was XXXX  XXXX  and I sold securities and opened up accounts for this bank. My credentials have to be immaculate and spotless to work in a bank. I have a high profile in my community and this is a dangerous black mark I can not abide with.

05/15/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"We bought our house on XXXX XXXX XXXX, with XXXX XXXX.  Unfortunately, our mortgage was sold to Freedom Mortgage right away.  We never made one payment to XXXX, we have always made the payments to Freedom Mortgage.  When our mortgage was sold, my husband and I read their 1.7 star reviews and knew that this was not a reputable company, but seemingly, we were stuck with them.  In hindsight, I wish we somehow fought for Freedom not to take over our mortgage because dealing with them has been an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE.  Our original mortgage payment was XXXX, including our escrow account for taxes, homeowners insurance, and our PMI.  Unfortunately, I cannot attach an original statement because their website only goes back 6 months and doesnt allow you to see any payment history prior to that.  In XXXX XXXX, we received our mortgage statement with a new payment of XXXX due in XXXX  (see attached of XXXX  statement.) On XXXX XXXX, we received a letter from them (attached) stating that they had previously sent us an escrow check in the amount of XXXX, as well as an escrow analysis.  In the letter it stated that if we didnt receive this, to call them and they would reissue the check.  I called them on XXXX XXXX XXXX, told them we never received that, and they told us they would issue another check to us and it would take 7-10 business days.  We never received that, so I called back on XXXX XXXX.  The woman I spoke with said whoever handled it previously never submitted it, and she would take care of that now and it would take another 7-10 business days.  
On XXXX XXXX, my husband called them since we still hadnt received this elusive escrow check.  The woman he spoke with told him that the escrow check was canceled because now our account was showing an escrow deficit, so not only would we not receive the check, but our mortgage payment was increasing to XXXX.  There was no prior communication of this and we would have never known if we hadnt called them.  We did receive an Escrow Account Disclosure Statement dated XXXX XXXX (attached) that explained this, but we didnt receive this until XXXX XXXX, over a month later.  When my husband got off the phone after 18 minutes, I called them back because I was not satisfied with the explanation given.  I was on the phone for 59 minutes talking with a woman who explained that when our taxes were analyzed, they werent analyzed for county taxes, only town taxes.  I went through our closing disclosure (attached) and explained that it states county and town taxes were included, and that there is a XXXX  estimate of XXXX for both the county and town tax (attached.) (When I called the tax office, our town and county taxes are paid together, as one fee.)  On our closing disclosure, it states that the town property taxes are XXXX a month and our county taxes are XXXX per month.  When I explained this on the phone, the woman said that something seems off with the account and she isnt sure what happened, so she was going to have it audited and put it in for review herself.  Again, we were told we would hear back in 7-10 business days.  
	On XXXX XXXX XXXX, someone from Freedom Mortgage did call me (for the first and only time since this started) and I missed the call so I called back.  I spoke to a man who explained our escrow analysis was incorrect for XXXX  and thats why we were in a deficit.  He blamed this on XXXX, stating that this is what they received from XXXX  when they acquired the mortgage, but according to our closing disclosure, XXXX  did their job and estimated the taxes.  I have also attached the Initial Escrow Account Disclosure Statement from XXXX  for XXXX XXXX-XXXX XXXX.  On this sheet, it states that our payments to the escrow account would be XXXX a month, resulting in our original XXXX mortgage payment.  After that document, I have also included the portion of Freedom Mortgages Escrow Account Disclosure Statement that shows their projections for XXXX XXXX-XXXX XXXX, showing our escrow payment to be XXXX.  That is almost XXXX less in projected escrow payments.  Freedom Mortgage clearly analyzed our taxes incorrectly, tried to place the blame on another mortgage company, and then we had to pay for their mistake so our mortgage payment went up. 
In that same call, the man I spoke with also told me that an XXXX payment had been applied to our account on XXXX XXXX, the same day I had previously called to discuss the escrow check, and that our payment of XXXX, not the new amount of XXXX was due in XXXX.  XXXX  payment had already been applied to our account, which was also reflected on their website.  I asked him to tell me which account that XXXX payment came from because neither my husband, nor myself had made that payment, he said he is not authorized to tell me which account it came from.  My husbands uncle knows our account information and has paid money towards our mortgage before, and we had assumed this was the case.  This was an incorrect assumption on our part that Freedom Mortgage would apply money to the correct account being that all of the account information had to be on the screen, including our loan number and names.  We received a letter (attached) on XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX confirming the above payment.  It is our loan number, however, not our last 4 digits of our bank account, which I stated in that phone call.  
	On XXXX XXXX, I called to ask why our mortgage payment was XXXX instead of the XXXX that I was told it would be on XXXX XXXX and why on their website it still says that we owe XXXX.  I was told because of our escrow deficit, but I explained that we were told on the phone of XXXX XXXX our XXXX  payment would be XXXX.  We then received two letters on XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX respectively (attached.) The first letter states they have been trying to contact us about our account.  I have not received more than one phone call from them, nor any voicemail.  The one I had received was the missed call that I previously stated. At this point, I had contact them so many times that if they needed to discuss anything about my account, they had many opportunities.  The second letter states that our account is 2 payments past due and to call them.  When I called them on XXXX XXXX to ask how this is possible, because we have never missed a mortgage payment, let alone been late on one, the woman told me the XXXX was rescinded and applied to the correct account.  I explained that I said it didnt come from our accounts when we were told about it.  She told me that it was a huge error on their part because in order to apply a payment to my account, all of my information, including our loan number, needs to be on the screen.  Again, I was told that she would look into it and we would hear back in 7-10 business days.  Our XXXX  payment was drafted from our account on XXXX XXXX XXXX, so at this point, we were only 30 days behind because of that XXXX payment. We then received a letter dated XXXX XXXX (AFTER I called the previous day) saying they have assigned us a single point of contact.  This has been of zero help because every time I do call, no one knows what the last person said.  I have to ask everyone to go back in the notes and listen to the recordings.  
	Since we had not heard back, yet again, my husband and I called on XXXX XXXX and were on the phone with them for 111 minutes.  We were first connected with a woman named XXXX, and we asked immediately to speak to a manager.  We explained the entire story to the manager and she said that she would apply the XXXX back to our account to take care of it. We told her not to do that, it wasnt our money, and it was just going to make more of a mess.  She finally understood that we were concerned because of their mistake, now we are considered late in our mortgage and it is going onto our credit report as a late payment of 30 days, plus we are being charged late fees on top of that.  She was able to get it off our credit report for XXXX  (attached) since it was their error, but then told us to just go ahead and make another mortgage payment to get us caught up.  I told her that since our XXXX  payment was already drafted, we didnt have the money to make another mortgage payment 6 days later.  She told me that there was nothing else she could do, so again, I asked for it to be escalated.  I was put in contact with someone named XXXX.  I explained the entire situation again, and XXXX  told me that she would try to get it deferred to the end of our mortgage since it was their error so we wouldnt be considered late on our credit and we wouldnt need to pay late fees.  Again, we were told we would hear back in 7-10 business days.
	On XXXX XXXX, not having heard back from them again, I called and immediately asked it to be escalated.  I was put in touch with XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is apparently a supervisor for the loss mitigation department. She told me that since this was their mistake, she was going to try to bypass the regular application for deferred payments. XXXX  said she wanted to get in touch with XXXX  from my previous conversation to get all of the details correct. Again, I was told we would hear in 7-10 business days.
	On XXXX XXXX, I yet again had to call them.  I asked to speak to XXXX  and gave her ID number.  She was in training that day, but I was told they put a message in the system for her to call me.  I was also told that our concern was in underwriting, but that I needed to respond by a certain date and since I hadnt, they had to submit it again.  I was told that if Im not notified that I have to respond, how would I ever know that and I was also told that someone would call me.  I was told again, I would hear in 7-10 business days.
	On XXXX XXXX I called back and spoke to a man who again, put in a request for XXXX  to call me back.  He said he understood my frustration and hopefully they could get to the bottom of this.
	On XXXX XXXX I called again.  I was told that I did receive a call on XXXX XXXX  I went through my phone logs and didnt see a missed call from them, nor did I have any voicemail from them.  I explained that now we are in the process of trying to finance our car since our lease is up and we cannot get financing because we have two payments on our credit report of 30 days late.  I said that this is completely ruining our credit and in turn, our livelihood.  Before this, we both had great credit.  He went through the notes and explained to me that in order for the payment to be deferred, it has to be more than 30 days late.  I was NEVER told this before.  In order for that to happen, he wanted us to stop our automatic payment due to come out XXXX XXXX XXXX  so that way it would be considered more than 30 days late and then it can be deferred.  We absolutely cannot do this.  Two 30 day late payments have already significantly damaged our credit, we cannot have it damaged even further.  
We need this resolved and taken off our credit report immediately.  It is harming our livelihood, and they have gotten away with this for too long.  Dealing with anyone at this company is a disgrace.  My husband wanted me to escalate this back in XXXX, but I kept telling him to let them make it right.  I should have listened to him because this is going on 6 months of no communication between the employees who work there, no communication between Freedom Mortgage and the customer, the employees do not seem to understand what they are doing, they all give you the runaround, they dont call you back, they dont communicate information, there are grave mistakes made.  There are no notes on their website, any letter we have received from them comes an untimely two-three weeks after its dated.  All of these conversations I have had with them are all well documented because they record every conversation.  It says at the beginning of the call and I asked them because I have asked them to go through the recorded calls.  They all seem to agree on one thing: that it was their error in the first place, but no one can do anything to help you.  We have been patient enough and have given them the benefit of the doubt, but now we are escalating this in every way we possibly can.

02/04/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"I believe I am the victim of internal Fraud within Wells Fargo Bank. There was an unauthorized transaction of {$10000.00} taken out of my Wells Fargo business checking account without my knowledge or consent on XX/XX/XXXX. I saw it when I logged into my Wells Fargo online account on XX/XX/XXXX and called them immediately. 

They said the situation was handled, they said they processed a stop payment and that the amount would be back in my account in XXXX days. That never happened. Instead I received a letter in the mail a few days later saying my report was denied due to too many days having past between when the money was taken and when I reported it. 

However the letter had the wrong dates on it, and the wrong amount. I escalated the issue XXXX times over the last month. It's been denied every time, with them saying the amount was {$10000.00} ( XXXX cent more ) and that it took place on XX/XX/XXXX and I reported it on XX/XX/XXXX. ( Neither are correct ). 

I've spent XXXX hours over the past month both in branch and on phone with their customer service, and every department you can think of. The claims dept, the fraud dept, etc. 

The situation has been grossly mishandled for the beginning and I still have not been able to retrieve my funds. 

On XXXX occasions, they have sent me conflicting information, with phone numbers to call for the merchant who supposedly received the money but both have been phony. 

I filed a report both with the police and the FBI. 

No one at Wells Fargo can tell me who they sent the money to when they took it from my account. They can not provide me with a swift number, an account number, a name, a bank name, a trace number, nothing. They have sent me around in circles on a wild goose chase. 

No one at Wells Fargo has been able to give me correct or accurate information about who took it or where it went or how to get it back. I've had the case escalated to the top XXXX times now since it happened, and the responses I get from them do not have accurate information, they also have conflicting information, the contacts they give me for the merchant have been different XXXX now, and those merchants have either a fake phone number or have no record of ever receiving the money from Wells Fargo. The dates, and amount, are also not correct on the emails they send me. I've been working with the police on the case and they have advised to escalate to FBI, which I have done. 

The last message I received from this morning was an email, pasted below. When I cal the merchant they listed, the merchant has no record of any transfer from Wells Fargo. They said they can not look up the person 's account without Wells Fargo providing the account number it was supposedly sent to, which Wells Fargo has been unable to provide. Every one at Wells Fargo I get transferred to says they do not have access to that information and then transfer me to someone else.

01/12/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"Summary : I am a victim of an elaborate job posting scam that began XX/XX/2022 which led to me sending a recipient two XXXX  transfers using the XXXX service offered thru my bank Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2022, to pay for training materials and a laptop. Note the scammer had sent me a check for XXXX the day before, to cover the XXXX XXXX transfers however it turned out to be stolen. 

1st XXXX transfer was done XX/XX/2022 at XXXX EST. 
2nd XXXX transfer was done XX/XX/2022 at XXXX EST. 
At XXXX the scammer then requested I locate a "" XXXX XXXX '' ATM right away to exchange XXXX cash for XXXX. I did not complete this request and I called Wells Fargo at XXXX to report the scam transaction and to have the XXXX transfers reversed. They left me with the impression I should get the funds back in about 10 days but that didn't happen. 

Notices I received days later via us post office from Wells Fargo : 1 ) Notice dated XX/XX/2022 acknowledging fraud claim XXXX submission and that they are looking into the matter. 

2 ) Notice dated XX/XX/2022 stating they determined the payments were processed as requested however as a courtesy they will continue to attempt to assist with a resolution with the receiving financial institution. 

3 ) Noticed dated XX/XX/2022 stating the two XXXX transfers have already been approved and processed and they are unable to stop or reverse the funds. Also they notified the receiving financial institution and XXXX Network about the scam and they submitted a request to have the funds returned however it is not guaranteed. They have closed the claim. 

It is a very poor business practice to process XXXX transactions without a reasonable window of time to reverse the transaction especially with the number of scams happening these days. Note these ( 2 ) transactions were to purchase a laptop and training materials and even though it was under fraudulent pretenses, I paid for something I didn't get and Wells Fargo and XXXX should provide a form of purchase protection if not like one receives with credit card purchases. 

I have a lot of support documentation to provide if needed : Initial text offering to engage in an interview with a link to access the scammer Chat history using XXXX application with the scammer Image of stolen check and the XXXX envelope used to send it to me.

These violations pertain to the unauthorized disclosure of my nonpublic personal information to non-affiliated third parties without proper notice or consent, a clear breach of privacy regulations outlined in the aforementioned laws.

Congressional Findings and Compliance Obligations : 15 U.S. Code 1681 emphasizes the critical importance of fair and accurate credit reporting for the efficiency of the banking system. It mandates fair evaluation of consumer information by reporting agencies and stresses the significance of consumer privacy protection.

Consumer reporting agencies are legally obligated under 15 U.S. Code 1681e to implement procedures ensuring the highest accuracy of consumer reports. Continental Finance Company/Celtic Bank 's disclosure of inaccurate information violates these obligations and breaches statutory provisions.

Details of Violations : 1. **Disclosure of Nonpublic Personal Information : ** Continental Finance Company/Celtic Bank without obtaining requisite consent or providing proper notice, disclosed my personal information to non-affiliated third parties namely XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX This action directly violates the Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S. Code 552a ) and the FCRA ( 15 U.S. Code 6802 ).

2. **Failure to Provide Opt-Out Opportunity : ** I was not offered the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of my nonpublic personal information, as mandated by the FCRA 15 U.S. Code 6802 ( b ), exacerbating the violation.

3. **Continued Right to Opt Out : ** As per 16 CFR 313.7 ( f ), I reserve the right to opt out at any time, a privilege denied to me by Continental Finance Company/Celtic Banks actions .

4. **Exclusion of Transaction and Experience Information : ** Continental Finance Company/Celtic Bank included transaction history within reported information, violating the exclusionary provision of 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ).

The unauthorized disclosure of my personal information by Continental Finance Company/Celtic Bank has caused significant financial and emotional distress, disrupting my life.

Remedial Actions Demanded : 1. **Immediate Deletion of Reports : ** I demand the immediate deletion of any reports or disclosures made by Continental Finance Company/Celtic Bank that contain my personal information, specifically transaction history.

2. **Compensation for Damages : ** Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681n, I demand compensation of {$1000.00} per violation for the damages incurred due to Continental Finance Company/Celtic Bank 's willful noncompliance.

I request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to take swift action against Continental Finance Company/Celtic Bank to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations outlined above. Your intervention is crucial to rectify this situation promptly and hold the institution accountable for their unlawful actions.

Enclosed are supporting documents detailing the violations and their impact on my financial and emotional well-being.

02/12/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"The application used to apply for the Chase XXXX XXXX is evidence of an offer from Chase ( offeror ) inviting me ( offeree ) to make a binding contract. An offer is part of contract negotiations where a party agrees to do or not do something in exchange for consideration. An offer must be stated and delivered in a way that would lead a reasonable person to expect a binding contract to arise from its acceptance. An offer gives the offeree the ability to accept and form an enforceable contract. When a valid offer is made, an acceptance by the offeree creates a binding contract. An offeror generally can not retract the offer once the other party has accepted. 
The offer to contract was a simple exchange between Chase and I. In exchange for my signed promise to pay ( application ), Chase would open an account in my name and issue Card ( s ) as I direct. The said offer was accepted for value and consideration and the contract issued back to Chase for the promise of performance to provide the said consideration. Once fully executed the said application became a security, specifically an instrument in the form of a promissory note evidencing a promise to pay a monetary obligation. The pricing information, terms and conditions and other certifications formed a Security Agreement ultimately giving Chase a Security Interest in the Security. This is evidence of Chase taking the security by means of a purchase however, Chase did not provide me with any consideration when they purchased the executed application which is a financial asset ( 12 CFR 360.6 ( 2 ) ) from me ultimately breaching the contract for failure to provide consideration. 
Failure of consideration is a concept which relates to the law of contracts. In contract law, a party trades something of value in exchange for consideration. The term failure of consideration implies that the consideration, which was sufficient at the time of bargaining, has ceased to be sufficient. This could happen if the consideration offered becomes worthless or miniscule compared to the value of the contract, or if the party promising to furnish the consideration fails to do so. It is a failure to provide consideration if Chase invites me to make a contract by way of an offer and I accept the offer under the impression that the consideration that I will have an account opened in my name and Card ( XXXX ) issued as I direct and once the offer is accepted you take the financial asset and provide miniscule consideration in exchange for it. This is evidence of misrepresentation. 
A misrepresentation is a false or misleading statement or a material omission which renders other statements misleading, with intent to deceive. Misrepresentation is XXXX the elements of common law fraud, and other causes of action for fraud, such as securities fraud. Securities fraud is the misrepresentation or omission of information to induce investors into trading securities. 
"" Any false representation of material facts made with knowledge of falsity and with intent that it shall be acted on by another in entering into contract, and which is so acted upon, constitutes 'fraud, ' and entitles party deceived to avoid contract or recover damages. '' XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The primary definitions from the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 similarly define securities as specific instruments such as a note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture and any instruments that fall into broad categories like investment contracts or any interest or instrument commonly known as a security ( see 15 U.S.C. 77b ) Under 17 CFR 240.10b-5 - Employment of manipulative and deceptive devices It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. 
Chase misrepresented and omitted to disclose within the terms and conditions of the application certain facts in order to induce offerees into unknowingly selling Chase securities and regardless of satisfactory credit rating or approval or denial Chase during the regular course of business purchases the applications and is able to use the applications as securities that can be pledged as collateral to the XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to receive advances which in turn creates money. Chase also can securitize the applications by way of asset securitizations in which applications are used as receivables and sold to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the receivables. Chase also takes the application as a promissory note and credits an account creating new money. The above-mentioned Financing Activities are further evidenced and on record within Chase 's Securities and Exchange Commission filings . 
It is not necessary for rescission of a contract that the party making the misrepresentation should have known that it was false, but recovery is allowed even though misrepresentation is innocently made, because it would be unjust to allow XXXX who made false representations, even innocently, to retain the fruits of a bargain induced by such representations. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
SETTLEMENT PROPOSAL I am asking for Chase to provide me compensation for the security which they have no right to retain. Therefore, I propose that Chase opens an account in my name and issues me the Chase XXXX XXXX with open-end credit and provides that the accounts monthly balance is secured by the payment Coupon associated with the monthly statement to be used as a Negotiable Instrument payable in U.S. Dollars and clearable through the US banking system. 
This Breach of Contract and Fiduciary Duty could have interesting consequences as I could be forced to contact and file complaints with various Federal Agencies, including but not limited to The Securities and Exchange Commission, The Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for Securities Fraud, violations of Consumer Protection Laws, and Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices. An investigation may uncover a scheme in which securities fraud, misrepresentation and omission of information was used to induce investors into trading securities that Chase uses to further enrich their card business while depriving the underlying account holders their intangible right to honest services. I firmly believe that an amicable resolution is in the best interests of both parties. However, I am fully prepared to pursue arbitration among other legal proceedings that would be necessary to uphold my intangible rights and protect my own interest in the executed application which is a financial asset and a security.",None,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NC,28212,None,Consent provided,Web,02/12/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8331631

06/29/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I had given up hope of getting this resolved but recently heard from another person who was struggling with the same issues with XXXX XXXX and getting reimbursed for tours that were never provided. She communicated to me that you had helped her recover her money. 

I went through all the normal channels to try to resolve this. Some of the tours we purchased through XXXX and charged to my Chase Sapphire card and others were purchased directly through my Chase card. 
I went through XXXX and Chase 's complaint systems and then Chase 's insurance, finally sending a letter to XXXX XXXX, CEO Consumer & Community Banking at JP Morgan Chase & Company. I also Cc 'd XXXX XXXX, CEO JP Morgan Chase. Neither replied directly, just had a higher up minon reply with a canned statement I need assistance with goods/services, in this case tours never received. I booked several trips in good faith with a company that appeared to be in good shape and was operating tours. My friend had gone on several trips and highly recommended them. They were badly affected by Covid, as was the travel industry in general. While they struggled to reopen, they didn't cancel trips, just rescheduled them ( some, several times ) further into the future. There was no way to know the tours weren't going to happen until the company went into liquidation. They even offered a very discounted tour with airfare to anywhere they travel, but the trip couldnt be taken until XXXX. They guaranteed in writing that if the future XXXX trip couldnt be taken in XXXX, everyone who purchased would be refunded. Their general refund policy stated that if any tours were unable to happen by XXXX ( due to Covid, which yhey blamed all their issues on ) we would be refunded. Then they changed the date to XXXX! Just before they went into receivership, they changed the date of refunds to "" if unable to travel by XXXX ''. Could they legally do that? 

When they opened back up after Covid, they were struggling to provide all the tours that were rescheduled multiple times and ultimately went into receivership in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I will now not get my tours nor a refund from XXXX. I alway use my Chase card for booking future trips because some book up XXXX yrs in advance and I trusted they would take care of me! 

I am devastated! I lost my husband in XX/XX/XXXX, have unexpected bills to pay and am not in a position to absorb this loss! 

I understand credit card companies not wanting people to wait indefinitely to ask for money back if I purchased an item and didn't receive it in a timely manner, but I don't understand the 160 or 540 day time limit after a purchase being applied here to trips that kept getting rescheduled. The final tour dates weren't available until after they went into receivership! So how were we to know we wouldn't get the tours until XX/XX/XXXX?

When the payment was not posted to my XXXX XXXX XXXX account, I raised an inquiry to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX and received an acknowledgment and a reference / payment confirmation number.

Fifteen minutes later Wells Fargo sent me a message notifying me they had closed my inquiry. The message also said they needed me to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX directly and they tried to contact me, but could not. On XXXX I requested the evidence that Wells Fargo used to close my inquiry and was later informed that it would be provided in 30 calendar days.

I called wells Fargo again only to find out 2 more accounts were opened. I spoke with fraud department again and created a case. I asked numerous times how can accounts still be getting created with a fraud case open and alert of my social. The lady has no answer but assured me the current two accounts would be closed. I too it upon myself to look up the codes on the account numbers and noticed the accounts were being created around Nevada area. I live in North Carolina.

I didnt hear anything for a month and on XXXX XXXX XXXX, I got another email saying they were delighted to welcome me as an applicant to XXXX. I thought maybe they needed another application since Id submitted one for the real XXXX  already, or another round of questions like with some other jobs Ive had. So they asked me to fill out questionnaire stuff and I put a lot of effort into the whole process.. I emailed for XXXX  weeks back and forth with this person calling themselves XXXX XXXX  claiming to be a director of Human Resources at XXXX The email they used at first was XXXX  and then they used XXXX from XXXX XXXX  which was the first time we started emailing back and forth consistently. I know I didnt pay enough attention but I was very eager to have a better paying job that would benefit me career wise while in college. On XXXX XXXX, I was asked to receive an E-check from this person and to print it myself, which I didnt know anything about printing or not printing checks, I rarely have used checks in my life and dont know anything about them so, anyway, I went to staples after receiving it via email, and printed the first check for XXXX. I then mobile deposited it on Wells Fargo mobile deposit app, which was suggested by this scam artist, and waited for notification that the money was ready for me to access. The scam artist emailed and asked me to send them the money back for payment for computer equipment as my position at the company would be customer service stuff online. They also told me to keep XXXX  of the money for my first weeks training pay. I am not familiar with how checks clear at banks so when Wells Fargo told me I had access to XXXX  of the dollars immediately and that I would have the rest by the next few days, I thought I was good to go and that everything was legitimate. This was my biggest mistake in this whole entire thing. I will never make it again. Anyway, I then emailed and said Wells Fargo told me it had to wait for the rest of the money to be accessed and the scammer said its okay let me know when the check  clears. I then went to Wells Fargo on XXXX XXXX to withdraw the XXXX  in cash. The banker didnt ask me any questions as I was explaining that I was new to a big fancy job at XXXX XXXX  doing customer service. The bank teller smiled and said oh good luck. I then went to XXXX XXXX XXXX  where the scammer told me to go to deposit the cash into a business account for them to use for my equipment purchase. This time the teller didnt ask me a single personal question and I didnt talk about anything in particular. I think this would have raised some flags with someone if I was asked more questions. I then emailed through my phone email app telling them I was successful in depositing the cash. They told me get a receipt of my deposit and then take a picture and tear the receipt up. I did think some of this process was weird but I hadnt had a serious job ever so I didnt know what to expect. I repeated this process of receiving an E-check from this scammer two more times. I deposited XXXX  more the second check, on my phone into the Wells Fargo app and then I withdrew it as cash from Wells Fargo in person and then I drove to XXXX XXXX XXXX again and deposited all XXXX as a second payment for this expensive equipment. I was given XXXX  more dollars as pay for my second week of training on a third e-check that I mobile deposited that equaled XXXX. The training so far was non existent, we just emailed back and forth about me starting with the company and they sent me screenshots of fake company software. The last of the 74 emails between us was them saying they admire my dedication to work and I thanked them for the opportunity, and then I said I successfully deposited the third e-check after printing it and was gonna go get the cash when it was available for a third time. On XXXX XXXX  at XXXX, I got an email saying a check I tried to mobile deposit has been returned fraudulent. I went and looked at my checking account on the app and it said it was negative by at least $1,000 and that number kept going up when the other checks got returned fraudulent too. The account is currently overdrawn about XXXX as of XXXX XXXX XXXX (I cant see the exact number amount anymore because theyve closed off access to the account.) When I received these emails I was shocked and rocked to my core because I realized that Wells Fargo had led me to believe in one way or another that the checks were able to produce money. I have screenshots of everything. All the emails. I filed a police report and I even have a detective that is on my case trying to help me. I contacted the Wells Fargo customer service 24 hour line for reporting fraud as soon as I saw the emails around XXXX on XXXX XXXX  because I was panicked and was told to call back in the morning to speak with a banker. I went in person to Wells Fargo that morning and asked about the possibility of me explaining to someone over the phone what happened and basically I was told to file a police report and open a case with the fraud department at Wells Fargo. I contacted multiple people in multiple departments on multiple different dates when this happened, answering questions, making a case to have this resolved and to clear my name. Wells Fargo has said theres nothing they can do for me since I went and withdrew cash from my checking account and then deposited it to another banks accounts. They want to collect the debt and move on but I just dont feel right letting it go.

08/09/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"American Express errantly billed me XXXX times for charges I never made. I contacted them by phone in mid XX/XX/2023 to find out what the charges were for. They told me that they did not have access to this information, so I would need to contact XXXX to find out. After contacting XXXX and learning they had no record of any charges whatsoever on these dates, I informed AmEx that XXXX had reviewed the disputed charges and confirmed verbally and in writing that there was no record of any goods having been purchased or any other transactions related to these charges and that my bank account associated with the card had likely been defrauded. I also told them that the XXXX representative with whom I spoke told me that all these charges had originated from AmEx XXXX and that someone there now had our bank account number and routing number. He advised us to take precautions to avoid further likely fraudulent withdrawals from this bank account. We did so immediately. The AmEx representative with whom I spoke that day assured me that AmEx XXXX XXXX would investigate and void the charges. They did so for XXXX of the XXXX charges. However, they have continued without explanation to demand payment for XXXX of these charges, ironically, the largest amount. 

Since my initial complaint to AmEx, I have had numerous phone calls and e-chat interactions with their representatives. Initially, I thought progress was being made toward a resolution when several representatives at different times reinstated my card that had been frozen and apologized to me. AmEx even issued me a new card with a new number because they said that my original card had been fraudulently compromised. XXXX representative said he could see the record of what had transpired and told me that the large charge would be removed, noting that sometimes these things take several months. 

Despite several favorable conversations and e-chats, however, the large charge has never been credited to my account. Despite my multiple efforts to convince them that the charge for which they are demanding payment is fraudulent or their error, they are continuing to place dunning phone calls to me multiple times each day, as well as leaving me voicemails, texts and emails. As of today, they are XXXX  to cancel the card by XX/XX/2023 and turn this matter over to a collection agency if I do not immediately make arrangements to pay them. This inappropriate and unwarranted action on their part would damage my credit rating and subject me to further dunning. They are demanding payment of {$470.00} including accrued interest charges. Needless to say, I don't wish my XXXX XXXX to be adversely affected by this action or to continue experiencing frequent XXXX However, I am unwilling to pay them for a charge that I never made. 

I have repeatedly asked them verbally and in writing to communicate with me only via email regarding this matter, since I am often out of the country without access to mail, phone messages or texts. However, they have not done so. Several of their representatives have verified that I have made this request upon review of the records. They have assured me that American Express would honor this request. Unfortunately, AmEx has not done so, further amplifying my distress.

In addition, American Express has in its possession audio recordings of my repeated and extensive phone conversations with multiple representatives on a number of different days. They also have transcripts of several extensive e-chats on multiple different days as well. These materials are not available to me at this time, but will further validate my complaint, their refusal to honor my requests that they stop dunning me, the extensive amount of time that interacting with them has required from me, and the distressing processes to which they have subjected me to without resolving my simple and empathetic claim ( confirmed by XXXX and my bank ) that I never made any charges this year including the one for which they keep billing me.",None,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,NC,27514,Older American,Consent provided,Web,08/09/23,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,7375282

11/07/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"Issue 1 : On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a 1 way flight on XXXX XXXX for myself -- from XXXX to XXXX to leave XX/XX/XXXX. The amount was {$140.00} and the confirmation number was XXXX. I did not realize the ticket had gone through and a few hours later -- purchased the same exact flight ( same itinerary, passenger, etc ). That amount was {$110.00} and the confirmation number was XXXX XXXX 

I then cancelled the {$140.00} flight ( XXXX ) and received a cancellation email 2 hours after the initial email. So, basically, I'd purchased 2 one-way flights with the same itinerary and same passenger and cancelled one within 2 hours. 

PER the US Department of Transportation 's 24 hour rule -- airlines are required to issue a full refund without penalty for flights cancelled within 24 hours of purchase. For some tickets, tickets must be purchases at least 7 days before a scheduled departure. ( My flight was cancelled 2 hours after purchase and was purchased on XX/XX/XXXX -- - 7 days out. It was to depart on the XXXX. I presented all of this to Wells Fargo, included the cancellation emails and DOT 's policy. The claim was denied, citing that Visa sided with XXXX. However, when I spoke to VISA, they said they don't make decisions -- -they simply provide guidance/guidelines. 

Prior to contacting Wells Fargo -- I tried reaching out to XXXX. Before booking, I did not realize the didn't have a customer service hotline. I emailed them on the XXXX and got a response on the XXXX saying I wasn't eligible for a refund, but that I could get a full credit. ( THAT was a lie. ) For 1 ) XXXX charges {$99.00} to make any changes to tickets, so how was I eligible for a refund, but not a credit? 2 ) I was within DOT guideines of cancelling the flight and receiving a refund. 

XX/XX/XXXX -- -Wells Fargo reversed the provisional credit and asked when I askesd why, they said XXXX responded to Visa and said I didn't mean the requirements. That's all I got. DESPITE the fact that all of my booking and cancellation shows that it was within DOT 's policies. 

If ANYONE looks at my booking date, cancellation date and time, the departure date, and the DOT 's guildlines- it should've have been obvious I was eligible for a full refund. 

I have SINCE gotten in touch with XXXX via XXXX XXXX This time, they told me to file a dispute with them for duplicate purchase ( since I had 2 flights for the same person and the same dates and cities. ) After doing so -- -they then said they couldn't do anything since there was a chargeback with the bank. HOWEVER, the bank has reversed the claim. So XXXX got FOUR ( 4 ) one-way flights from me and of course, I only took 2 flights Issue # 2 : On XX/XX/XXXX, I also booked a return trip on XXXX airline ( from XXXX to XXXX ) to depart XX/XX/XXXX. The flight was scheduled to leave XX/XX/XXXX. This flight was {$160.00} and Confirmation XXXX. 

However, when I looked at the confirmation email that was sent -- it wasn't the flight that I booked. The times were different ( similar departure times, but the emailed flight had a 7 hour layer in XXXX and wouldn't arrive in NC until midnight. Again -- I tried to get in contact with XXXX about this change, but I couldn't. I was given form responses that I would have to pay {$99.00} change fee, despite me booking the correct flight initially. SO -- -I was forced to cancel the XX/XX/XXXX XXXX flight and book ANOTHER flight that was {$210.00} ( # XXXX ) and had the correct times. 

So, I filed a dispute for flight Confirmation XXXX ( which left 30 mins earlier than what I'd originally booked ) and arrived 12 hour later. 

In sum -- I purchased 4 one-way flights from XXXX. ( 2 for the same itinenary and cancelled one within 2 hours of purchase and 7 days of departure ). The other 2 one-ways ( same itinerary and passenger ) and cancelled one and repurchased b/c the dates on the confirmation were wrong and XXXX wouldn't fix it. 

I spent a total of over {$600.00} on 4 one-way flight and only took 2 and I am eligible for a refund. This was my first time flying with them, but it's been a nightmare and even more so that Wells Fargo who I've been with since XXXX is not properly reviewing guidelines.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NC,27804,None,Consent provided,Web,11/07/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7815381

03/14/23,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"In XXXX of XXXX, I made the grave mistake of applying for an apartment at XXXX XXXX. They are student apartments near the XXXX XXXX XXXX, managed by the XXXX XXXX. 

At that time I was working in Charlotte, but shortly after applying for the apartment, my job was to be relocated to another city and state. All I completed with XXXX XXXX at that point was an application, or so I thought, since that was what it was entitled when I filled it out. I was told in order to keep my spot, I would need to first be deemed financially qualified - either by myself or with a guarantor, and pay a deposit. 

As soon as found out that my job was not going to be in NC anymore, I called and emailed both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX to let them know that I would not be able to complete the process. Mind you, they do not allow move-ins before XXXX ( which is a normal procedure for most student apartments ). So they had from XX/XX/XXXX until XXXX of XXXX to simply rent the apartment to someone else. However, they illegally informed me that me signing my APPLICATION ( which is what they are claiming as a rental agreement ) was the same as signing a LEASE with them. 

So after no resolution with XXXX nor XXXX XXXX, I ultimately resigned from my job, and began applying to other jobs local to Charlotte, believe what they told me that I was now responsible for the apartment. I was able to find a new job and emailed the leasing office my first 3 paystubs. However , XXXX XXXX called me to inform me that I was not even able to self-qualify after running a credit report and reviewing my check stubs. 

I thought that would have been the end of this issue since I did not have the credit score nor the income to qualify for the apartment. But nooo XXXX XXXX XXXX continued to send me harassing emails and call me saying that I needed to get a guarantor to sign the lease and I was still financially responsible even if I lose the apartment. ( How the heck does that even work?? ) I even explained to them that everyone, including my own mother refused become a guarantor on an apartment for me ( I was XXXX years old at the time and a non-traditional online student returning to finish my degree ). Then XXXX XXXX said I would need to get a sub-leaser to take over the apartment, but again, how can someone sublease an apartment they didnt lease in the first place? 

After speaking with a lawyer, I was told that what they did to me was completely illegal, the application and lease are separate entities and until an apartment complex has qualified me financially and run a background check, then there would be no reason for them to present me with a lease until that has been completed and approved. Also, I can not be financially responsible for an apartment that I never rented, nor lived in. I dont think in the history of landlord-tenant law, has there ever been a case where an applicant who had not been approved for an apartment, was later held financially responsible for the apartment rather than it just being rented out to someone who actually qualified for it. 

I dont often check my credit report, but I received an email in XX/XX/XXXX and went on the XXXX website to see why my score had decreased recently. To my absolute shock, it was a collections notice that had been sold to a law office acting as a collection agency on behalf XXXX XXXX XXXX, in the amount of {$8000.00} for 12 months of past due rent from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX- for an apartment that I literally NEVER received keys for nor stepped foot in! 

I immediately called the phone number listed for the collection agency and informed the representative that the entirety XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX claims were fraudulent. I even asked the representative what address XXXX XXXX XXXX claiming that I owe rent for? She read off the address of my ex-boyfriends fathers house ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC XXXX ). A house he OWNS, not XXXX of their student apartments, but an actual two-story house with a mortgage, that is miles away XXXX XXXX XXXX and has absolutely no relation to that company!! 

XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC XXXX was the actual apartment XXXX XXXX XXXX assigned me after attempting to financially qualify but later was denied. So I found out that they decided to remove that address from their collection claim and used my home address ( seen in the screenshot below ). After I disputed the fraudulent charges with the credit bureau, they are now using my ex-boyfriends fathers home address to continue the collections process against me. 

For them to first use my home address to start the collections process and then use my exs dads address rather than the actual address of the apartment they claim I owe money for, tells me XXXX XXXX XXXX did exactly what I asked for in the beginning- they found some other person to rent that apartment! I know this because it is illegal for a landlord to charge a person rent for the same lease for a single property after it has been taken over by another person. And If you know anything about student apartments, they get filled up quickly! XXXX XXXX even sent me marketing emails saying that they were full for the fall move-in for XX/XX/XXXX ( which means the apartment they claim I owe them money for had been rented out! ) Then after explaining everything that happened to the collections representative, I was simply told that all I can do is submit a dispute to them in writing. So I will be doing that and I have already disputed this unfounded claim of debt to XXXX and the FTC. 

You have to remember that during this time period, many landlords and leasing companies were struggling financially because of lost rents from the XXXX XXXX Moratoriums across the country due to the impact of XXXX and the rise in unemployment.

In spite of this, they continue to call my personal cell and send emails to my personal email even though we do not owe this and they have been notified by mail not to contact me by cell or email. Also, they never responded to this letter or argued proof, they simply keep trying to collect the debt. 





XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NC XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , OH XXXX RE : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX , I am in receipt of your letter. Upon opening it and reading it I did not find ANY enclosed documentation. The letter states there is documentation attached There was nothing but your letter. My guess is that no documentation exists because there isnt any. 

Your firm has obtained a bad incorrect debt as XXXX DOES NOT owe anything to XXXX XXXX XXXX 

The story is as follows. The above XXXX XXXX, acquired XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. At curbside there was a large pole and street signs for XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. See included photos. On the pole XXXX XXXX had their phone number, so I call to enlist their services to replace the XXXX XXXX Sign ONLY with the new XXXX XXXX sign. I originally spoke with XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. I have attached her original email in which she was under the impression this was a double- or two-sided sign. She mentioned it in the email saying this was a quote for the faces PLURAL of the existing sign. I know why this happened. The last order for the prior owner, XXXX XXXX XXXX at this address was for TWO signs. One for XXXX XXXX and the other for XXXX XXXX. 

When I ordered MY new sign from XXXX she initially quoted me over {$1800.00} XXXX thought it was excessive and paid the half down required anyway. Sometime later in another phone conversation with her she looked over the order and mentioned a two sided sign. I explained it was for a one-sided single sign and she recognized the error, asking if I wanted the other sign. I told her the nail salon was still there and I would only be replacing the XXXX XXXX panel. She then said it would be half. And since I had already placed my order and gave my deposit the balance was then XXXX according to her. 

Weeks after the sign was installed, I received a bill for the original {$1800.00} amount. I called XXXX and she apologized, stating it was an error and that I was all paid. I thanked her and thought that was the end of it. A few weeks later I received a call from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in accounts receivables asking for the amount again. I explained what happened and that XXXX should have fixed the error. See included email where XXXX indicates more than the required deposit was received but there was still a balance. There is clearly a disconnect inside XXXX XXXX accounting and the email is proof. After my response to XXXX I thought the matter was resolved. I got another call from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX saying it was correct and that I owe the balance of {$970.00}. I explained once again what happened and she should speak with XXXX. I told her I DO NOT OWE this. I assume she placed the matter with your company in an attempt to cover up XXXX mistake and ineptitude. 

In conclusion, XXXX DOES NOT owe this. The corporation has never owed this and I consider this matter closed. Also, I am an XXXX of this Corporation and I AM NOT liable for this debt either. DO NOT call my personal cell number. Should any further debt collection activity continue or if any negative reporting takes place as a result I will file a formal complaint against your company according to FCRA guidelines and seek damages, attorneys fees and other charged in court.

05/19/23,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"This is a story of both personal accountability and corporate negligence. In XXXX, XXXX, with $ XXXX in my bank account from selling my home, I went to a store to finance a couch set for 12 months at no interest in the amount of {$2800.00}. The store ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC ) used TD Bank d/b/a XXXX I received my statement and input my account number and routing number intending to pay $ XXXX to pay it off in roughly 6 months. My payment never processed, and I was told I was late. I am never late. I called the company to remit the payment over the phone. To my surprise, that did not work either. Frustrated, in XXXX, XXXX, I called to remit the payment in full which was now up to approximately {$2900.00}. That was not returned either and I was told there were no issues showing on their side with the account. It's also worth noting, that I could not see what the issue was either as the Acc/Routing numbers are semi-redacted with "" XXXX. '' Fast forward to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I ended up remitting a total of {$3400.00} after re-submitting my account information. Remember, I at all times had the money t0 pay for the couches in full. I am fortunate to make a six-figure salary as well. 

Present day -- I am applying for a home loan and see that my account was marked "" derogatory '' for failure to make payments on time. I was and am livid. How could this be when I attempted so many times to pay the couch in full? Well, after 7-8 phone calls with pleasant but unhelpful representatives, I find out that there was one digit incorrectly input in my original input from XXXX, XXXX. That one digit was the source of my late payments, NSF assessments, and ultimately, a "" derogatory '' account mark on my and my wife 's credit scores. I was previously above XXXX and am now in the XXXX 's. I am being forced to pay an increased loan origination fee of roughly {$3700.00} with my home lender because of this derogatory account marker on my account. 

It seems to me that a consumer finance company should have measures in place to assist customers that actively try to pay their credit card accounts but experience typographical or technological issues. I received no phone call, email, or any indication during any of my multiple phone calls where I voluntarily tried to resolve the issue. And now, the company has made an additional {$600.00} from the late fees, and I am being cost {$3700.00} more that I would not have had to pay otherwise. 

My complaint is based in failure to diligently assess customer behavior. I was very clearly attempting to make my payment. But that was of no consequence to this company. It's a sad world where companies destroy peoples credit and unfairly cost them money. I had all the best intentions, apparently made an error, and now I will pay almost {$4000.00} plus additional interest over the cost of my 30 year home loan.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,NC,27616,None,Consent provided,Web,05/19/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7000509

10/02/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"On XX/XX/2023, my car was broken into in a parking lot and my purse was stolen. At XXXX, I realized it had been stolen and turned off my credit card, trying to figure out next steps as I was still working with a client and was unable to give it my full attention. Between XXXX I received a series of emails from Wells Fargo stating that my debit cards were being charged. In total, 3 Wells Fargo debit cards were used at a nearby XXXX, and 4 transactions were attempted : 2 for {$500.00} and 2 for {$500.00}. Only 1 out of the 4 transactions went through, and the others were declined. All declined transactions were marked as "" insufficient funds '', although at least one of the accounts certainly had sufficient funds, so I believe it was declined for suspicious activity. I also received an automated Fraud Alert email at XXXX, asking me to verify two of the transactions on the same account : {$500.00} which was approved ( this is the one my claim is for ), and {$500.00} which was declined. This email shows that their system automatically flagged the transactions as fraudulent. 

As soon as I was able, as I was still with my client, I turned all of my cards off ( some were automatically turned off due to fraud detection ) and called the police, then Wells Fargo. I filed a police report and my clients gave witness statements. I spoke with multiple Wells Fargo representatives to order new cards and report the one approved transaction as fraudulent ( this call took place around XXXX ). I was told I didn't need to report the other transactions as fraudulent because they were declined. Wells Fargo issued me a provisional credit for that {$500.00} transaction. I then went to the XXXX store where the fraud took place and searched through trash cans to try to locate my purse, as well as speaking to a store manager who reviewed the security footage and confirmed that two men in masks had used my cards to attempt to purchase {$500.00} XXXX gift cards, and were successful at purchasing two - one with my aforementioned Wells Fargo debit card, and one with a credit card from another bank. 

On XX/XX/2023, the provisional credit was reversed, and I was charged {$500.00}. I noticed this on Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX, and called Wells Fargo, and was told by a representative that I would need to call back the following day to speak with someone at the claims center. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the claims center and was told that the claim was closed with no evidence of fraud and they would not provide me with any information as to the reason. I then went to my nearest Wells Fargo branch, sat down with a banker, and he went through the same steps that I did and was told on the phone that no information would be provided and they would not reopen the claim. On XX/XX/XXXX, I found a letter from Wells Fargo from XX/XX/XXXX that I had not previously seen, informing me that I was entitled to copies of the documents used in making the decision to close my claim. I called the number listed and requested those documents, and was told it could take up to 30 days to receive them and that even with these documents, my claim was highly unlikely to be reopened. 

Wells Fargo 's website states that "" Wells Fargo Debit and Credit Cards come with XXXX Liability protection at no extra cost. You wont be held responsible for unauthorized card transactions, as long as you report them promptly.

This account is being reported by XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 
In addition to my dispute reasonings, this is a notification of I, the consumer ordering a cease and desist. Meaning after receipt of this letter, By law Celtic Bank has no right to contact me via any form of communication. This includes through phone, email, and my consumer report. Failure to abide will result in legal action being taken. 
The payment history for this account is completely inaccurate amongst all agencies. XXXX has no payment history for this account. XXXX is showing a first delinquency date of XX/XX/XXXX with no payment history to show forth, and a report date of XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX and XXXX show a report date of XX/XX/XXXX. 
With this account being only updated as of XX/XX/XXXX, instead of updated and verified, I can only assume that the proper action was not taken to investigate the validity of this account. All the account information remains the same even after numerous disputes of the same inaccurate information. 
In addition, the amount for this account is XXXX dollars. Meaning, nothing is owed to this creditor. This information should not be furnished on my report if there is no monetary obligation. This account is also listed as paid on XXXX. The date of last activity is not listed on XXXX. As a consumer, I have the right to receive complete information. By allowing this incomplete information on my report I am unable to determine several things. XXXX of which includes, when the statute of limitations runs out. 
This furnisher failed to comply with their obligation of supplying I, the consumer with a complete and accurate credit report. This account also does not reflect my disputes from XXXX nor from XXXX in the comments section of any agency. 
This is well over XXXX inaccuracies that Ive listed. This furnisher had numerous chances to rectify the situation when disputes were sent out and failed to do so. Instead of handling the situation appropriately, they instead knowingly furnished inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent information on my report. 
Delete this account for being in violation of the FCRA. 

( a ) Duty of Furnishers of Information to Provide Accurate Information ( XXXX ) Prohibition ( A ) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors. A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. 
( B ) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors. A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. 


The following is the obligation listed by the CFPB pertaining to companies ' responsibility to remove unverified information. 
The FCRA provides people multiple ways to dispute inaccurate information on their credit reports. Commonly, people dispute the accuracy of information on their credit reports with a credit reporting company, such as XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX. In response, the credit reporting company often refers the dispute to the company that provided the disputed information. When a person submits a dispute to a credit reporting company, and it is passed along to the company that originally provided the disputed information, the company is then required to conduct its own investigation into the disputed information. 
If a company that provided disputed information to a credit reporting agency is unable to determine whether the information is true or not, the law requires them to tell the credit reporting company the information could not be verified so that the credit reporting company will stop reporting it. Nonetheless, some companies have argued that if they are unable to determine that the disputed information is false, they are free to tell the consumer reporting company to continue providing the information on reports. 
Thats wrong, as the CFPB and FTCs brief explains. In the FCRA, XXXX put express requirements on companies with respect to information that can not be verified. Those requirements would be meaningless if companies could continue providing unverified information and telling credit reporting companies that they could continue sharing it. 
If this account is not deleted I will have means to assume this is an act of willful noncompliance which is punishable by the following : Any person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( XXXX ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure; and ( XXXX ) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Continental Finance Company, LLC",NC,28083,None,Consent provided,Web,05/15/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,9002050

They wanted me to pay to replace the box, as well as pay over {$600.00} to have it towed to their dealership. We had just drained our savings account trying to fix this car and could not afford it. It sat in the shop for so long, citadel finance sent the title to the car to the shop and told them they could have it. We called our attorney immediately because our bankruptcy was not finished and we had the car included so we would not be responsible for a loan for a car we were essentially screwed out of. Upon receiving notice of the discharge of our bankruptcy, the finance company immediately began reporting 4-5 months of late payments ( during the time period this all occurred and the car sat in the shop ) and reported the loan to my credit and it dropped my credit significantly. I called to resolve the issue and they said they would be pursuing me for the loan amount and late fees and that bankruptcy does not change anything. Now my family is down a car and no way to get another because most car companies arent willing to help me with my late payment history of this car that I was CURRENT on. I do have the ability to contact the shop and receive proof and I have access to receipts where i paid for various car parts trying to fix the issue.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Citadel Finance Company,NC,28086,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,09/05/23,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,7147249

01/07/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Delay in processing application,"Hello, I was trying to purchase airline tickets for a month and luckily found good price on XX/XX/XXXX. I wanted to buy the tickets using the XXXX airline website and they were advertising a promotional offer of {$400.00} statement credit and XXXX bonus points to open American Express XXXX XXXX. 
Since I have an excellent XXXX XXXX I attempted to applied for the card to take advantage of the promotional offer. 
So therefore, I started the credit card process prior to purchasing the airline tickets so that I can take advantage of the offer. I was able to qualify for American Express XXXX XXXX and the website approved the cards. I waited for few minutes to receive temporary credit card account number so that I can proceed with the tickets purchase but that did not happen. I never received any emails with the temporary account number. 
Waiting after few minutes, on the same day XX/XX/XXXX I called American Express XXXX XXXX and was immediately transferred to a representative who informed me that she do not have access to my credit credit information and that I must wait to receive the email with a temporary account number. Knowing that the ticket price will expire in few minutes/hour, I called XXXX airlines and the wait was XXXX hour and XXXX minutes by the time. 
By the time I got the customer representative on the other line the ticket prices were already expired and were showing much higher prices than before. I explained to the representative that I wanted to make the purchase using my newly applied American Express XXXX XXXX account to take advantage of the offer but have not received the temporary account number to proceed with the purchase. She asked me the details regarding the date of travel, flight numbers, destinations, booking class and said that I can make the purchase on any other card on hand and still get the current offer. So therefore, I proceeded purchasing the refundable tickets fare online at much higher prices since the good prices were expired due to all the delay I encountered with the wait time to speak with an American Express and XXXX airline representatives. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called American Express XXXX XXXX inquiring about my credit card as I only received the secondary member card and not my primary card, and they said that I would not receive a temporary account number via email due to security reason and my credit card is still in transit and will not receive it until after a week. I asked her about the promotional offer stating whether I would be qualified to receive the {$400.00} statement credit as advertised and she said the I would not be qualified since I did not make the ticket purchase using the card. She recommended that I call XXXX XXXX to see if they can cancel my transaction without any fees or penalty and that I buy another tickets with American express credit card as the prices were same. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX and the wait time was XXXX minutes, the representative said that the tickets I have purchased are not fully refundable, although it clearly stated that the fare I purchased is refundable. 
I am in a very frustrating situation as I only got entice to open American Express XXXX XXXX credit card due to the {$400.00} statement credit. If I had known that they were not providing me with the temporary credit card account number I would have not applied for the card. 
Bottom line, my credit score went down due to new activity, bought the airline tickets at a higher price as the prices were expired by the time I got to speak with a representative, I can not get full refund on a refundable tickets. 
In theory, I lost the {$400.00} statement credit and also bought the airline tickets at much higher prices, lot of misleading information from the representatives, delay receiving new credit cards and the long wait times going back and forth trying to sort this matter but everything to no avail. 
All I would like is to get {$400.00} statement credit as advertised.

10/03/23,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"I am writing to follow up on the open case [ XXXX ] that I have filed against Chase Bank , which pertains to alleged debt collection activities. The following accounts in question are : XXXX XXXX, XXXX & XXXX. It has come to my attention that Chase Bank has failed to comply with legal requirements and continues to engage in harassing and improper debt collection practices, despite my prior complaint and your intervention in this matter. 

As previously communicated, I have been inundated with an incessant stream of illegible documents from Chase Bank, none of which substantiate their claim that the alleged debt is indeed mine. Moreover, Chase Bank has not adhered to the established legal standards by failing to provide clear and valid documentation supporting their claim.

Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692, debt collectors are required to provide consumers with clear and concise verification of the debt 's validity upon request. To date, Chase Bank has not met this fundamental obligation. The documentation they have provided remains ambiguous, leaving me in a state of uncertainty regarding the legitimacy of the debt in question. 

Additionally, I have received a generic letter from Chase Bank asserting that I did not provide sufficient information for them to initiate an investigation into this matter. This assertion is both misleading and inaccurate, as I have provided all necessary information required under the FDCPA and your agency 's guidelines. It is clear that Chase Bank is attempting to obfuscate their non-compliance with the law and evade their responsibility in resolving this dispute. 

Chase Bank 's actions in this matter not only constitute a breach of the FDCPA but also demonstrate a disregard for the principles of good faith and fair dealing, which are foundational in contractual relationships. Pursuant to the FDCPA and other relevant consumer protection laws, consumers are entitled to fair, transparent, and honest treatment during the debt collection process, which Chase Bank has flagrantly violated. 

I have attached the correspondences received from Chase Bank, which clearly illustrate their unwillingness to cooperate in good faith. I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to take swift and decisive action to compel Chase Bank to adhere to the law and fulfill their obligations under the FDCPA. 

In light of Chase Bank 's continued harassment, lack of compliance with legal requirements, and their failure to provide clear evidence substantiating the debt 's validity, I request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau take all necessary measures to ensure that Chase Bank promptly ceases its improper debt collection activities and initiates a thorough and legitimate investigation into this matter. 

I appreciate your prompt attention to this serious matter and trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will uphold its mandate to protect consumers from abusive and unfair debt collection practices. Please keep me informed of any developments in this case and the actions taken by your agency.",None,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NC,27511,None,Consent provided,Web,10/03/23,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,7620350
09/18/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Money was taken from your account on the wrong day or for the wrong amount,"To : Whom it may concern ; From : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XX/XX/2023 On this date I deposited {$46.00} from XXXX to my bank account with Wells Fargo. This transfer occurred at exactly XXXX ( screenshot available ). I logged into my Wells Fargo account at XXXXXXXX XXXX ( one minute later ) I was showing an available balance of {$46.00}. ( screenshot available ) ( screenshot was made at XXXX ). I use XXXX and those transactions usually post to my Wells Fargo account after XXXX XXXX. Within the past two weeks. Wells Fargo has developed a habit of taking money from my account to pay for XXXX XXXX purchases before they post to my account. At XXXXXXXX XXXX Wells Fargo account showed ( per screenshot ) that I had {$46.00} available. There were no XXXX XXXX transactions posted at that time. Had there been XXXX XXXX purchases posted to my account, my account would have been in the negative and not showing an available balance of {$46.00}. So as always I XXXX my first transaction of the day into another account to use for gas and lunch for the day and I always pay my XXXX XXXX transactions ( after they post ) within 24 hours of posting. My account history will prove this to be true. 
Ive been with Wells Fargo for more than a year and for months Ive transferred earnings in the morning to move into another account via XXXX and then after XXXX post the XXXX XXXX transactions I pay them within the 24 hour grace period that is supposed to be afforded to all customers. On this date Wells Fargo intercepted my money and took my money that I transferred into the account before they posted XXXX XXXX. Again, my account was not in the negative but at the exact same time they took my money to pay for XXXX XXXX transactions that were not even posted yet. Please note I am not or will not deny my XXXX XXXX transactions. But I cant control when Wells Fargo post them to my account. ( per screenshots ) On XX/XX/2023 the day before this date. Wells Fargo notified me at XXXXXXXX XXXX  that my account had a balance of XXXX. ( If they can notify me at XXXX this in fact shows they could have notified me of the XXXX XXXX prior to XXXX XXXX on this date. ) On XX/XX/2023 on this date and ONLY AFTER I made a phone call to complain about this issue. 
Wells Fargo texted me at XXXX XXXX that my account at XXXX had a balance of {$14.00}. This is exactly one minute after XXXX transferred {$46.00} into my account. ( ONE MINUTE ) Wells Fargo took {$32.00} from my account prior to posting any debt from XXXX XXXX. ( screenshots available ) Between XXXX/XXXX/2023 at XXXX XX/XX/2023 at XXXX there is not one single transaction or debt posted to my account. 

Wells Fargo Grace Period policy : With Extra Day Grace Period you have an extra business day ( not weekend day ) to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees. If your available balance covers the prior business days overdraft items as of midnight Eastern time, well waive the associated overdraft fees. this is Wells Fargos policy So Monday is a business day which means the XXXX XXXX should have posted negatively on Monday allowing me the business day to pay it and avoid overdraft fees. 

{ Separate : I want to also note that last week they charged me an overdraft fee on my account in less than 24 hours of a debt being posted- I brought this to their attention and the overdraft fee was waived but not until Wells Fargo banker insisted that I was to blame. I dont work for Wells Fargo I cant control when they post things to my account and I cant take the blame for when they decide to post transactions to my account. } Wells Fargo is not giving me the same grace period as they are affording every other customer, they are intercepting my transfer from XXXX before they even post the debt to my account and give me the 24 hour grace period. This is not fair and I dont feel that its a legal practice seeing that it ultimately is a discriminatory and unethical practice of taking ones money in advance of posting debt. Would it be fair if my energy company came into my account and took {$100.00} for a bill that doesnt even exist yet. No, that would be illegal. So what Wells Fargo is doing is no different. They have no right to intercept my deposit to cover debt that they have not posted. They have no right to intercept my deposit to cover a debt or balance that has been in negative for less than 24 hours on a business day. This is according to their own policy. 

When I called Wells Fargo at XXXX on this date to make a complaint about what I just explained above. The banker denied any wrongdoing and refused to give me back my money and post the XXXX XXXX as they should have done in the first place. The banker denied that he could see the activity I was referring to but had no problem posting it after the call ended. This phone call was recorded according to XXXX. 
I am attaching screen shots of everything regarding this matter with the exception of my account history but am willing to provide that in a more secure setting if needed. 

Timeline XXXX XXXX, 2023 XXXX Transferred money from XXXX to my Wells Fargo account XXXXXXXX XXXX  logged into my XXXX account to send money from my account to XXXX XXXX Available balance {$46.00} ) XXXXXXXX XXXX attempted to send money through XXXX and it failed stating I did not have Enough funds in my account to make the transaction. 
XXXXXXXX XXXX Wells Fargo took {$32.00} from my account ( without justification ) no XXXX XXXX posted XXXXXXXX XXXX Wells Fargo shows my account has a balance of {$14.00} XXXX XXXX I called Wells Fargo XXXX Wells Fargo sent me the only notification for the day that my account had a balance of {$14.00} as of XXXXXXXX XXXX ( no notifications that my account is overdrawn- no XXXX XXXX posted ) Wells Fargo can not legally justify taking {$32.00} from my account because they have not shown on my account at the time they took the money WHY they were taking it. At this point they could have been {$32.00} from my account to put in their pocket because they didnt give any post, notification, listing, balance update ( nothing ) prior to taking my money from my account.

12/21/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I have had a Morgan Stanley Private Bank Account and an E*Trade account since XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( they are linked under a single sign-on ). My accounts have always been well-funded ( never overdrawn ) and Ive never used the margin on the brokerage account. 

I have set up wires from the MSPB account several times online. On XX/XX/XXXX, one of the contractors working on my house left before I could bring him his check. I told him Id send him a wire if he could send me his account info. He sent me his acct. and routing number, then I put the rest of the beneficiary details ( name/address, etc. ) from his invoice onto the outgoing wire transfer request. The wire was for {$2000.00}. I sent it one time, then got an email saying the wire transfer had been canceled, I was in a hurry and tried it again, got the same email again. Then, I tried it for a third time for XXXX XXXX thinking that may make a difference ( though I hadnt reached any daily wire limits ) got the email that the wire was canceled again. I had the account page open all day and was day trading throughout the afternoon. Then, the internet dropped and logged me out. I tried to log back in and it said my User ID was inactive due to unusual activity and to call the E*Trade. 

I called E*Trade and was told to submit a letter of instruction with my signature, copies of my DL and SSN card, and a copy of the most recent statement of the funding account XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I submitted everything and they said great, we will unlock your account in 3-5 business day and you can go back to normal, I said, heck no, I am closing this account because this is ridiculous and you can just wire my cash back to XXXX XXXX and can do an ACAT for my existing positions to my other brokerage account. Called back 4 business days later and they said they needed to do a three-way call with me and XXXX XXXX to verify my identity. We did the three-way call and everything was satisfactory to the E*Trade CS Agent -- he told me that the back office would need to review everything and that a new 3-5 business day window would now begin for their review. That was on XXXX I have called back every 3 and 5 business days and am told it is still under review but that have my wiring instructions and ACAT ready.

They have her the same response - the account is still under review and they cant provide a timeline for when I can have access to my funds or positions, but that is should be soon.

I disagree with their decision because I have documentation supporting how I made many attempts to close account and pay off balance and although I first disputed the claims the company was making it took over 6 months for them to even address the issue in any substantive way and it was only after I filed the CFPB complaint. 

I closed the account in XX/XX/XXXX and attempted to pay the balance in full except for the late fee which was disputed because they never notified me of an address change for the payment mailing address. In a previous statement, the company stated they notified me in XX/XX/XXXX but this is not the case. If this was the case then why wasnt it until XXXX of XXXX when my payment was returned? I was never notified of the address change and I had been mailing my payments to this same mailing address for years automated through my bank account. 

I have attached a conversation from XX/XX/XXXX through the chat on the AMEX app that supports my allegations. I appreciate them making a monetary fix but please fix what has erroneously been reported to the credit bureaus. I had been an AMEX customer for years and I never had this problem with erroneous late fees and interest charges until I closed my account in XX/XX/XXXX which they did not report accurately in their system until the disputes were continuously escalated in XX/XX/XXXX. It almost seems vindictive for me closing the account because I do not understand why I have been caused so much distress over what amounted to {$200.00} which I never should have been charged because I closed the account and filed a dispute when they kept adding on interest and late fees after the closure even though I had two separate AMEX reps quote me the final balance so I would cover the balance in full. 

I am attaching my conversation with an AMEX rep from XX/XX/XXXX. Again thank you for rightly removing the monetary claim. I ask that you please correct the reporting to the credit bureaus as well dating back to XX/XX/XXXX but at the very least dating back to XX/XX/XXXX when I closed the account and paid the balance in full based on the balance an AMEX rep told me in my best attempt to pay the full balance correctly. Please remove the erroneously reported late fee payment history given that no further charges should have accumulated once I closed the account and paid the balance in full and I should not be held responsible for not being told the change in payment mailing address when I have been making payments to AMEX at that address for years automated through my bank. If you have any questions, I am happy to answer them. This is in regards to AMEX account identifier XXXX with the credit bureaus. I will continue to escalate this issue as it goes against the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I am a physician who works very hard and at my wits end on why AMEX is not doing the right thing.

The text asked if I XXXX  a person for {$3500.00} and I replied no, as I usually do when contacted. The Wells Fargo Fraud Assistant called me to inquire about this transaction and proceeded to tell me his name and ID number. He also stated that he would never ask for my bank account number or any other private information or it would most likely be a scam. He won my trust in a short period of time. He also told me that I could lose all the money in my account by end of day if I didn't take action. He put me on hold while he talked to the Wells Fargo Bank Manager. Her name was XXXX XXXX. He then told me that I would need to XXXX {$3500.00} to his Wells Fargo Bank Manager, XXXX XXXX, and would get it back after midnight. I then did that. The next morning, I received a phone call from this same guy who stated he was from Wells Fargo Fraud and would need to protect my savings account. At that point, I realized it was a scam and told him I was going to the bank to talk to a bank person. I then hung up and he continued to try and call me back. I went to the bank on XX/XX/XXXX, and filed a report in the Wells Fargo Bank and told the fraud representative on the phone, I had documentation and could send it to her. She was not interested in getting anything from me and didn't seem interested in anything I had to say. I also went to the police department on XX/XX/XXXX, and filed a police report. I received a letter from Wells Fargo Bank stating that my claim had been researched, and there was no evidence of a scam, and my claim had been denied.

08/02/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"Dear Consumer FInancial Protection Bureau, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to lodge a formal complaint regarding an unresolved payment issue I am experiencing with Chase Bank. 

XX/XX/2023, I decided to switch banking institutions, from XXXX to Chase. Before the transfer, I made a final payment of {$2000.00} to my Chase Credit Card account. XXXX informed me that they were unable to close my account until the {$2000.00} payment was posted to Chase. 

XX/XX/2023, I initiated a transfer of {$2000.00} from my XXXX checking account to my Chase credit card account. Chase received and posted the transfer on the same day, as confirmed via my Chase Online account. XXXX, received the alert that my {$2000.00} was posted to my Chase account, proceeded to close my account. 

Later that same day, after my XXXX account was closed and the payment posted by Chase, Chase attempted to verify the funds. However, they were unable to do so and declined the {$2000.00} payment, citing insufficient funds. Chase made a second attempt to process the payment on XX/XX/2023, but it was again returned, this time due to the closure of my XXXX account. The payment was sent back to XXXX, but since my account there was already closed, XXXX was unable to reimburse me the {$2000.00} to Chase. 

I received a letter from Chase on XX/XX/2023, stating that they declined the {$2000.00} payment from XXXX and had blocked my XXXX account from sending any further payments to my Chase account. 

Chase claimed they do not have any information or records pertaining to the {$2000.00} transfer and do not have the returned funds. XXXX has confirmed the receipt of the returned funds from Chase, but XXXX could apply the credit the {$2000.00} due to my account closure nor issue a check, which leaves the {$2000.00} in limbo. 

In my attempt to rectify this issue, I have made numerous calls and spoken to several Chase account supervisors. XXXX provided a Transaction ID ( XXXX ), which I forwarded to Chase. However, Chase account mangers claimed they could not track or act upon this ID and requested further information such as bank statements. 

XX/XX/2023, XXXX XXXX, I coordinated a conference call involving both XXXX and Chase account managers, XXXX, XXXX account manager and XXXX, Chase account supervisor. During this call, we reached a resolution. XXXX agreed that Chase has processes in place, that are not recognized to other financial institutions. XXXX confirmed that he would credit the {$2000.00} back to my Chase credit card account and waive interest charges. He asked to send proof of payment a checking account statement showing that the {$2000.00} payment was made. Chase would conduct a missing payment investigation and reclaim the money. The documentation was provided via Chase secure messages, and they would contact me if Chase needed anything else. Chase applied my {$2000.00} payment to my credit card account. 

I thought he issue was resolved ; however, I received a letter from on XX/XX/2023, stating that the {$2000.00} payment was credited to my account in error on XX/XX/2023, and that the credit had been reversed. No further updates or calls were given to me regarding the payment investigation. 

XX/XX/2023, XXXXXXXX XXXX, I contacted Chase. While the account supervisor was initially helpful, their demeanor changed, becoming rather curt when I asked about the next steps. I was left in the dark, without any information about how to proceed to recover my {$2000.00}.

12/01/23,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Didn't receive advertised or promotional terms,"Further referencing CFPB complaint XXXX which was closed and using secure messaging or calling on the phone leads to generic responses which have nothing to do with issue and is futile. You closed the complaint XXXX stating I was ineligible for promotional rate because of me not meeting your "" credit criteria ''. 
- Your promotional email, ( stating you are changing my slate to freedom card, without me ever asking to change the card in the 1st place, I might add ) stated I already qualified and am to receive the promotional rate of 4.99 % and there is "" nothing else I need to do to receive this promotional rate '', hence why I received this email in the first place. Now in your response to the complaint you stated I didn't meet your "" credit criteria '' to receive this rate, yet I was never notified that I suddenly became ineligible for this promotional rate that you stated I already was getting. Which leads to 2 apparent fraudulent practices. 
# 1 - since it was technically a new credit card account that you changed without asking me, CFPB states "" A credit card company is generally not permitted to increase your interest rate on new transactions during the first year of your credit card account ''. Which may be negated if it is a promotional rate and doesn't fit this rule. BUT # 2 CFPB also states "" ... theyre required to provide 45 days of notice before an interest rate change '' -- I WAS NEVER GIVEN ANY NOTICE, MESSAGE, EMAIL OR ANY COORESPONDENCE OF INTEREST RATE CHANGE. Even if I suddenly didn't meet your credit criteria, I still am entitled to 45 day notice of any rate change. I need further explanation of how you are able to change rates without notice even though that is illegal. 

# 2 - Chase changed my credit card from Slate to XXXX, without my authorization, nor request ; and furthermore I never signed, agreed to or otherwise even received any acknowledgment or even was able to read a credit card agreement ( which would include interest rates ) and full terms and conditions before they suddenly changed my card, so I would have no idea what my interest rate was to agree to or even acknowledge, except from the email sent out stating it was 4.99 % promotionally. How can I have an agreement with chase if I was never notified or made to sign or agree to anything? 

# 3 - You responded claiming as "" evidence '' of me not qualifying for you promotional rate is that I suddenly didn't meet your "" credit criteria ''. 1. This "" credit criteria '' that I am to maintain to keep this promotional rate is not listed or qualified or quantified anywhere in any card documents. So essentially its a completely subjective, ie. fabricated criteria, that I am supposed to maintain, yet I don't know what I am to be maintaining?! Furthermore, your email stated I was already to get this promotional rate in your email on XX/XX/2023 when my credit score was XXXX and has been maintained in the XXXX 's range till the filing of my first complaint, so exactly when did I suddenly not meeting this unwritten "" credit criteria '' even though credit score was essentially the same, and what evidence, stipulation or expectation does chase have that I suddenly one day didn't meet your criteria and therefore you can disregard the promotional rate? Because I was never notified that I stopped meeting your credit criteria, nor what the criteria even was either.

08/19/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I am writing to formally request that my dispute, referenced as Claim XXXX, be properly addressed and be re-opened by Chase Credit Cards . It has come to my attention that there have been certain issues regarding the handling of my dispute, which I believe require clarification and resolution. The dispute has been rejected twice although I have provided chase proof of cancelled transaction, lack of provided services, and lack of quality from the merchant. 
On XX/XX/2023 I saw the advertisement for XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) on my mobile device and was initially convinced by the merchant 's selling agent about the potential benefits of the service. As a realtor, the proposition seemed appealing, and I proceeded with the purchase, paying a one-time fee of {$2400.00}. However, upon commencing the training the following day ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I realized that the billboard feature was simply a digital image generator with limited customization options, and the overall website lacked the desired level of professionalism, concluding with "" XXXX '' in the domain name. Furthermore, the promised assistance from agents in generating leads turned out to be automated bots, and I was instructed to rely on my own efforts to create links on social media platforms. I made multiple attempts to reach out for cancellation through phone calls and emails on the day following the payment, totaling at least four attempts. Despite my earnest request for cancellation, my appeals were denied, and I was informed that the refund could only be processed after a holding period of 12 months, as stipulated in the agreement. One specific concern that arises from this experience is the discrepancy between the services described by the selling agent and the actual offerings provided. Notably, I recall mentioning access to XXXX, a platform that appears to perform similar functions, but the agent assured me that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX were distinct and supplemented by agent assistance. Regrettably, my experience revealed a significant disparity between these representations and the reality of the service. To compound my dissatisfaction, upon conducting further research, I discovered a pattern of concerns regarding the quality of leads and instances of purportedly fake leads on the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) website. 

Primarily, I wish to highlight that I have not received any communication from the Chase team regarding the requisite documentation for this dispute. Furthermore, I observed a credit in my account statement, which seemed to suggest that the matter had been concluded. However, I believe this was premature, as I had not been properly informed or engaged throughout the dispute process. 
In addition, I have recently received supporting documentation from XXXX XXXX, which sheds light on my utilization of their services. It is important to note that my engagement with their services commenced immediately following my subscription. Regrettably, my experience exposed me to a significant disparity between the advertised quality of services and the actual provision. My contentions in this claim pertain to two key aspects : 1. Termination and undeliverable Services : I wish to emphasize that I have promptly terminated the services, substantiated by a record of email correspondence. This action was taken subsequent to my dissatisfaction with the quality of services rendered. Also, since the credit card charge back, my services were terminated from months ago. So there is no case that I have ever used the merchant 's services. The attached documents is also showing that since my profile was incomplete, no leads were provided, and thus services not rendered. 
2. Discrepancy in Advertised Services : The promotional material conveyed a commitment to high-caliber website design and collaborative human-led lead generation. Contrary to these representations, the delivered services featured a substandard website interface and an automated bot-driven lead generation process. The services rendered did not align with the assurances provided. 
Furthermore, it is pertinent to mention that, as part of a training module reaching a reported completion of 75 %, I created a personal website. I would like to assert that I did not revisit the platform after the initial interaction. In order to verify my limited engagement, I kindly request that activity logs or login records be presented. 

I affirm that I intentionally refrained from completing the module to express my lack of interest in availing their lead generation services. It is regrettable that I am unable to remove the website and platform from my profile, despite my inclination to do so. 
It is my understanding that under federal law, customers are afforded the right to cancel services within a three-day window. I wish to emphasize that I exercised this right on multiple occasions, substantiated by documented email correspondence as well as recorded telephonic communications. In light of the aforementioned circumstances, I am resolute in my decision to discontinue any further association with XXXX XXXX. The corroborative evidence presented through XXXX XXXX reviews underscores my concerns regarding their credibility and ethical practices. 
I humbly implore your earnest consideration of the facts presented herein. It is my genuine hope that this matter can be satisfactorily resolved in a fair and expeditious manner. Your understanding and prompt attention to this dispute are greatly appreciated.

I'll be surprised if chase bank doesn't get bailed out by the feds AGAIN because they are greedy, sneaky, and conniving I've verified my identity over 100 times, the branch manager even called them to confirm that I was in branch to verify my identity. They're saying they can't send my check because my address changed in the beginning. Mind you chase sent my new debit card and account closure check to my address on file nothing has changed. The chase reps do not care some out sourced XXXX customer service reps are very rude and blatantly nasty they don't care to help steadily repeating the same thing over and over again like a robot with no real solution. At this point I will no be calling chase anymore. I've emailed the CEO of chase as well ( XXXX ). iam not playing with my funds idc how much it is. The bank will send you in overdraft fees for their money. I think I deserve overdraft fees from them for almost 5 month inconvenience. At this point If I don't receive my funds I will be suing chase believe that! 

I've called chase over 100 times and still no one has rectified the situation. Even the chase branch manager call in to fix the problem still nothing no check was ever sent to me. If you can assist me in this manner I'd greatly and appreciate it. Thankyou for your time and help.

05/12/23,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I was called from the number ( XXXX ) XXXX last Wednesday, XX/XX/2023 stating that they were from my bank Wells Fargo and that some fraudulent activity was occurring with my account. I checked to verify the number on XXXX and Wells Fargo security resource associated with the number popped up so I believed it was informing me of my account. The representative told me his name was XXXX and proceeded to tell me that some fraudulent activity was occurring and that someone in XXXX TX was trying to use my card information to buy some XXXX XXXX for the amount of {$37.00} but they were able to decline it and that someone named XXXX was also trying to wire transfer themselves my the money in my savings account for the amount of {$4200.00}. He then proceeded to ask me did I give permission to wire money to the individual and I stated NO then he asked have I been using my card at any outside gas stations and I stated yes since a couple of days prior I did use my card at an outside gas station and is aware that some people do leave trackers to steal peoples card information and recommend that I use my card inside of stores for future references so I honestly thought maybe someone could be using my card information. I then checked my account and noticed that everything was still intact and told him that and he then told me that he could still see the the processing of the wire transfer occurring and wanted to help me stop it from going through. He even stated that whoever was trying to use my account/ scam me turned off my notifications so I wouldnt be able to be notified of what was going on and stated that he can assist me with getting my account changed into a new one so the transfer can be stopped. He then sent me a link to my phone to verify my information and started sending other links and codes to my phone number, I would read out the code to him and he would tell me that hes taking a look at my account and trying to stop the process of the transfer. A few moments go by from being on hold and he tells me that hes almost done working on my account and trying to get everything situated as well as trying to turn back on my notifications that were supposedly turned off. He was even able to somehow send me the notifications to my email from Wells Fargo of the guy XXXX trying to wire transfer my money to himself and then tells me hes going to transfer me to his supervisor so he could look over some things before finishing up with everything. A few more minutes go by and I was greeted by another man who stated he was his supervisor whose name I genuinely dont remember and was told by him that everything had been updated with my account and everything was taken cared of as far as stopping the transfer from occurring and was recommended that I not log back into my online banking due to the new changes and that I would receive a phone call the next day @ XXXX to be assisted with signing back into my online banking. The next day XXXX came and past and I called the XXXX number and was greeted by the Wells Fargo operator and explained everything that occurred the previous day and was told that they couldnt find any documentation of any fraudulent activity going on and was then transferred to the fraud department and then explained everything to them once again and was then told that thats sounds like what I occurred was a scam and that my account looked okay and when I went to log into my online banking I noticed that the money in my savings were gone and that the money was indeed wire transferred, I was able to file a claim and now Im just hoping everything can be completed and the money can be given back.

08/29/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"Im in a security breach situation with Wells Fargo Bank that has dragged on for almost eight months and hasnt been resolved to my satisfaction. I suffered no financial loss but I cant get answers to my questions. Ive changed banks because of the way that I was treated. I received a letter this week from Wells Fargo with its explanation of what happened, and Ive attached it for your perusal ( wf, XXXX ). Its terrible, in my judgment. Ive included my response to the person who sent the letter. 

XXXX what happened : On XXXX XXXX I checked my Wells Fargo account online, as I always do on XXXX. I could not login. The telephone number to send the security code was not my number. I called customer service and explained what happened. I gave the agent my checking account number and he found the account. After a few seconds pause, he told me that he could not help me. I asked why and he said that the name on the account was not my name. 

I asked for the name on the account and he would not tell me. I asked to speak to a supervisor and one came to the line. I explained the situation and gave him my Wells Fargo credit card number to see if a different account would reveal the problem. Same answer : the name on the account was not mine. This agent also would not tell me whose name was on my account. The supervisor, very coldly in my judgment, told me that he couldnt help and I had to wait until XXXX  to go to a branch and resolve this issue in person. Two hours later I called Wells Fargo fraud, explained the situation, and asked if a freeze could be put on the account until I could go to my branch on XXXX. I feared that my account could be cleaned out and charges made on my credit card. This agent was more understanding than the previous two but said that she could not help. 

This part of the incident is the source of my anger with Wells Fargo. I was not willing to wait XXXX hours with someone elses name on my account. I spent an anxious weekend worrying about what had happened and was at my branch at XXXXXXXX XXXX on XXXX. 

After XXXX and XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  of work with one of the branch officers, we found that an account had been opened in XXXX, XXXX, the previous week. The Wells Fargo agent in XXXX typed mistyped the applicants social security number and it matched mine. Wells Fargos security system did not pick up on a duplicate social security number. My account was merged with the applicants and he had control of his account and mine. 

I opened an account at a different bank the next day and closed my Wells Fargo account in XXXX once the transition was done. In XXXX, still upset by what happened and how I was treated, I lodged a complaint with Wells Fargo. I spoke with a pleasant woman named XXXX from Wells Fargo Executive offices and she began to help me. I was promised an answer by XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX called on XX/XX/XXXX to tell me the investigation wasnt complete and the bank would contact me by XXXX XXXX. 

I received a letter from Wells Fargo on the XXXX, and it is the attachment that I mentioned earlier. There are at least XXXX typographical and grammatical errors in it. Some of the explanation is so unclear that, to me, its gibberish. The man who sent it didnt even sign it. For me, theres no empathy or sincerity in the letter, especially for what I went through on the weekend that the situation happened. Its mostly a letter backing XXXX XXXX handling of the incident. Again, thats my thinking. 

Im still furious about this. I let it be known in a letter back to the Wells Fargo agent who sent the letter. In my judgment, Ive been treated horrifically since the first day when no one at customer service or fraud would help me. I held this account for 47 years, mostly at XXXX before it was bought-out by Wells Fargo XXXX And Wells Fargo ruined it in 15 years. For the time that I held this account, no one would help me and I had to go to a branch and prove my identity. 

Im sure that you have more serious cases than this. I didnt lose money, no charges were placed on my credit card and my debit card was not compromised. Wells Fargo still hasnt explained how a duplicate social security number wasnt detected and matched to a person who held the account since 1976. And it simply doesnt seem to care, at least not to my satisfaction. Im just a retiree with a checking account, but Wells Fargos actions were sloppy. Cold-hearted banking at its worst. Ive had bad experiences with businesses, but never one at this level.

05/09/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"On XX/XX/2023, I was made aware a checked had been posted to my Wells Fargo checking account in the amount of {$1000.00}. A scanned image of the check available online through Wells Fargo 's website revealed the following problems : the check did not appear to look like my checks and the signature was clearly a forged signature. I reported the check as fraudulent using Wells Fargo online banking, and I called the phone number indicated on the website to report a fraudulent check. 

Upon speaking to the Wells Fargo representative, I reported the check was not drawn by me, and was a fraudulent, forged check. I was made aware by this representative that the check had an incorrect routing number -- something that was redacted or otherwise cut out of view from my view on Wells Fargo 's online banking 's image of the check. The representative agreed with me that the signature did not appear to be mine -- after acknowledging she could see images of other checks I could confirm as legitimate. She further acknowledged the check itself did not look at all like my other checks, and she agreed the Wells Fargo graphic appeared to be suspicious. She further acknowledged that the check number was non-sequential with the other checks I had recently drawn on the account. 

After confirming she did no have the authority to expedite my request, I spoke with numerous other representatives who confirmed with me a claim had been opened and expedited to investigate the reported fraudulent, forged check. I was given no other assurances but the bank would respond within ten ( 10 ) business days. 

Approximately one week passed, and during said time I received no written correspondences from the bank notifying me a claim had been set up or other communications. I thereafter called the bank, and they confirmed a claim was set up for the purposes of investigating my report of a fraudulent, forged check. I asked for a status of the bank 's investigation and its findings, and When I demanded an explanation, I was informed by the Wells Fargo representative that such matters were privileged and protected information which could not be disclosed. 

Notwithstanding this, On XX/XX/2023, I received a letter in the mail dated XX/XX/2023, informing me that Wells Fargo had determined the transaction was "" posted correctly '' and the claim would be closed. There was no further explanation or justification for the bank 's decision. 

On that same day -- today -- I called the number indicated in the letter ( XXXX ). I indicated I was taking issue with the bank 's disposition, and I requested an explanation of the bank 's decision and the findings of that investigation. I was connected with a Senior Resolution Specialist within Wells Fargo 's claims department who informed me the bank had mistakenly coded or other inputted the claim as a non-fraud claim. When asked the basis and reason for this, the Specialist informed me I had reported the claim as a problem with the routing number. I informed him this was information unknown to me at the time I discovered the fraudulent check, and that I had only been made aware of the incorrect routing number by the initial Wells Fargo representative I spoke with. I requested to speak to someone with more managerial authority, but I was informed the only assurance I could be given was that a new claim had been set up, and I could only expect to receive a response via US mail within ten ( 10 ) additional business days.

The representative continued to issue me new cards ( send them in the mail ) and so I thought place a blocker on my account ( but she did not ). The fraudster had already stolen around {$400.00} by the time I realized and turned my cards off immediately. On that following Monday ( XX/XX/XXXX ), the fraudster went into a physical Wells Fargo branch and transferred everything out of my savings ( $ XXXX ) to my checking account and continued to withdraw {$490.00} without any identification or my debit card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from a manager at Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) that someone was there using my card and that she was now walking out of the branch.

I went to the location to pick up my ID and also call the police to put in another report for this incident. 

After arriving and speaking with the manager, he distinctly remembered her coming in that previous day and today. He said the woman came in stating "" she just needed money '' and that her "" mother and sister just passed away '' I'm assuming to get some sympathy. Two days before this day ( so XX/XX/XXXX ) and on XX/XX/XXXX, he informed me that the woman couldn't answer any of my security questions, the last 4 of my SSN, nor the person 's name attached to my account. This was very alarming because the point of security questions are to protect consumers and that's not what was done here. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I had my mother transfer the only {$130.00} left in my Wells Fargo account over to her personal account because it has now been going on for a week. After my mother transferred the money, a few hours later there was a post on my account for $ XXXX. The person had now done a "" deposit item return '' check ( I now know it's some type of scam check ) and knocked my account into overdraft big time. 

I called Wells Fargo back and no answers. My mother and I continued to call them to try to escalate this for days and didn't receive too much help. I continued to let them know that I've been a customer for over ten years holding a checking, savings, and now a mortgage. 

My mortgage is now late without this being resolved and this person has now taken over {$1700.00} from me. 

I did my part by informing them of the theft and turning my cards off immediately. They let the person continue to commit fraud and compromise my information by not closing my account ; now I'm being punished with this not being resolved or even credited because of their employees negligence.

02/16/23,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Unexpected increase in interest rate,"I am filing a complaint against Wells Fargo Bank for deceptive business practices and usury fees due to misapplied payments and lack of disclosure regarding promotional terms associated with promotional periods for purchases. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a purchase at XXXX XXXX and financed this purchase through Wells Fargo Bank. I purchased a dining room table with four chairs, as well as a sofa. Due to the table being less than {$500.00}, the promotional period terms were 0 % interest if paid in full within six months. The sofa 's terms were 0 % interest if paid in full within 24 months. In total, the two items were {$4100.00}. My current balance is {$2900.00}. To date, I have made payments totaling {$1100.00}, making monthly payments on time and in excess of the minimum payment due. I recently began receiving notices from Wells Fargo informing that one of my promotional periods was ending and would be assessed an interest rate of 28.99 % from the date of purchase if I did not pay the item in full. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a phone call to Wells Fargo Customer Service to inquire about this notice. I spoke with XXXX, who informed me that the promotional period for the dining room table was ending, and confirmed that I would owe the balance in full by XX/XX/XXXX or would be assessed the 28.99 % interest rate from date of purchase. She also informed that the balance due for the table by XX/XX/XXXX is {$490.00}. I discussed with her that I have paid more than the cost of the table and more than my minimum payment each month, so should not have a balance on this promotional term. XXXX stated that the payments get split between the promotional periods, and that if I wanted to have my payments applied to the shorter promotional period first, then I would need to specify that on my payment. I asked how a consumer would know to do this if this is not disclosed on the monthly statement and she could not answer. I stated to XXXX that I would like my payments to be reversed and then applied to the table first, paying off the table balance, and then apply the remainder to the sofa. XXXX put me on a brief hold and then told me that they can not reverse payments because my account would be sent to collections because it would appear as though I did not make my minimum payment. I was then transferred to another rep, XXXX. I restated my concerns to XXXX and again requested that my payments be reversed and applied to the shorter promotional period so that the table would be paid for, preventing the assessment of the 28.99 % interest charge from date of purchase. XXXX informed me they could not reverse payments. I asked XXXX how a consumer would know that payments were not being applied correctly, in order to remedy the situation before being assessed the high interest rate. XXXX told me that the breakdown was contained in the monthly statement. I informed XXXX that there was no such information contained in the monthly statement. I directed her attention to page XXXX of the monthly statement, which only indicates promotional terms for each purchase and the balance, but does not indicate how payments are applied so that the consumer knows to request the payments be applied in a different manner. XXXX then looked on page XXXX of the statement and acknowledged that it does not contain a breakdown of how payments are applied. Prior to hanging up on this call, I summarized my understanding of our discussion before I moved forward with filing a complaint. I summarized that payments can not be reversed and that Wells Fargo has indicated they do not have the ability to remedy this situation without me going outside of this agency. XXXX confirmed this information to be true. I then stated my awareness that Wells Fargo has been fined in the past for misapplying payments and incorrectly assessing interest, and that I will move forward with filing a complaint with the XXXX XXXX  The phone call was then terminated. Essentially, Wells Fargo misapplied payments and did not disclose this during the time of purchase or on monthly statements, resulting in an assessment of a 28.99 % interest rate.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NC,27410,None,Consent provided,Web,02/16/23,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,6574503
07/23/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"XX/XX/2023 a {$1000.00}. withdrawal was stolen from my checking account without my permission. After work, I went by the Wells Fargo ATM on XXXX XXXX in XXXX, NC to get {$20.00}. to send to my granddaughter. I put my card and pin in the ATM and it asked what amount I wanted. I checked {$20.00}. and a pop-up stated the machine was out of XXXX causing me to get flustered as I did not want another amount. I pulled off appx. 30 feet to the XXXX XXXX as I knew I could get the amount from XXXX XXXX. The minute I got out of my car, I realized that I had left my card in the ATM. Not more than 5 minutes elapsed when I ran to the ATM, saw my card and took it out. There was a young man standing in front of the ATM, not in a car and I said to him that the machine was out of XXXX. I went in the XXXX XXXX, made a purchase and got a XXXX back. I then went to the post office and sent the XXXX to my granddaughter. I then went home and as I do every afternoon after work ; went online to check and balance my account. It was then that I saw the {$1000.00} withdrawal from my account. I immediately reported the incident to Wells Fargo thus starting a series of events that have occurred to this date. On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo made the decision that "" I had either taken the money myself or I had given permission to someone to use my card '' That My card and pin were used is the only reason for them making their decision but I don't know of any ATM that you can drive up to and say "" Give me a XXXX  dollar bill '' and it does so.They have called me a liar and a thief or which I am neither. Appx. 3-4 days after the incident ; Wells Fargo tore down the ATM in question and replaced it with a new ATM appx. a third the previous size. I reported the theft to the XXXX Police Dept and my case was assigned to a Detective. I appealed the decision of Wells Fargo and again was sent a letter with the same decision and reasoning for such decision. In both letters, Wells Fargo has stated that "" it was my right to receive copies of the videos or pictures '' of said videos but that request has been denied numerous times. They won't release them to the Police, neither to the Branch Manager of the Wells Fargo Bank in XXXX, the only local office as the major office has recently closed. With these videos or pictures ; it would be made plain that I did not take that money. The release of these pictures is what I am asking for. I have lodged complaints also to XXXX XXXX in XXXX, NC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( who referred me to you ) and am working on a complaint with the NC Office of the Attorney General. Another question I have asked is "" how long does Wells Fargo keep these videos? '' NO ONE can tell me and I do believe that they are just hoping I will quietly go away and drop the matter. But they are wrong. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX, still work every day and have never had anyone call me a liar nor a thief. I have been with Wells Fargo for 18 years and have never had a problem with them other than this. I have copies of correspondence, phone calls with names and times, emails, police report and other contacts but I do not have the capacity to attach such to this complaint. I can fax such if needed or acceptable.

04/05/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Fraud or scam,None,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I found a home online through XXXX posted for rent. I submitted a request for more info and was contacted by the alleged owner on XX/XX/XXXX with information about who they are and why they are renting their home as a first time landlord. I filled out an application and was told they had approved me, and they sent even more information about them including family photos and IDs. I thoroughly researched everything they sent me and matched it to property records, reverse image searched the photos, and more. I felt comfortable enough to proceed with leasing the home based on what I found and what I was given. 

After signing an agreement I was asked to send the money for the security deposit through XXXX which is connected to my Chase bank account. I sent four separate payments totaling {$1600.00} between XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX to this person using XXXX through Chase. Two weeks later on XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered the person was a scammer who had done this to other people across the U.S., and was impersonating the owner by name. I immediately contacted Chase and spoke to two reps including a supervisor. The first rep said they will file a claim with XXXX which they claimed they would submit, however both the first rep and supervisor said they can not do anything else and will not return the funds to my account since I authorized the payments through XXXX ( despite having used the service via Chase ) and had no recovery rights and referred me back to XXXX. I was then directed from XXXX back to Chase 's fraud department and spoke to a third rep who took all of the information I had to give and directed me to consumer protection, who referred me back to the fraud department. The fifth rep I spoke to then said they would be sending my claim to XXXX on the next business day reiterating that's all they could do. Less than 24 hours later I received a notice from Chase stating no action would be taken and they closed my claim. This is a regular scammer who has already been known to do this, and will continue to commit these crimes as Chase has made it clear at this point they will do nothing to prevent it, will continue to allow it to happen and will not help their direct consumers in recovering their lost funds in these unfortunate situations by refusing to take responsibility and blame the "" third party service '' they directly promote and make available. This has also prevented me from being able to move as planned as the funds I lost were specifically for moving, which is all the more important to do now as I am unsafe with this scammer knowing where I currently live.",None,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NC,27513,None,Consent provided,Web,04/05/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6797049
