03/28/24,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I experienced a fraudulent ACH transfer of {$4800.00} from my XXXX XXXX account to an unauthorized XXXX account. The scammer cleverly spoofed XXXX XXXX 's customer service number, making it appear legitimate. While I didn't reveal any personal information, the scammer initiated the transfer regardless. 

Disturbingly, XXXX XXXX acknowledged they are aware of this spoofing tactic and that scammers replicate their scam alert process. Furthermore, they claim all customer information is already compromised on the dark web. 

My Concerns : Security Gaps : Why hasn't XXXX XXXX changed their customer service number or implemented stronger authentication methods if they know it's being spoofed? 
Customer Awareness : Why haven't they proactively informed customers about this vulnerability? 
Delayed Resolution : XXXX XXXX requires an investigation before crediting my stolen funds. This delay is unacceptable, and the stolen amount should be immediately reimbursed. 
This incident highlights a concerning lack of customer protection. XXXX XXXX seems aware of the scam methods yet fails to take adequate preventative measures. 

I urge XXXX XXXX to : Improve security protocols to prevent further spoofing. 
Inform customers about these scams and how to identify them.

This agency represented themselves as a time share exit team. They sent out paperwork to gather data about our purchase and then they sent me a numerical figure that they stated would be the amount needed to liquidate our timeshare. They shared information about closing cost, and what would be needed to transfer the deed. On XX/XX/2023 a transaction in the amount of {$11000.00} was made.

The representative from XXXX XXXX XXXX called after saying they didn't receive the cashiers check ( I sent it 30 days before noting the timeshare exit payoff in the notes section ). After I canceled the check at the bank, they asked if we could just debit the money as it would be quicker and we could move along the process to get out of the timeshare. I gave him the debit information and later that evening he sent a XXXX for me to initial electronically for the debit ( only one page ). Later on, when he sent me the finalized XXXX agreement, there were additional pages that showed a contract for purchasing into a travel program with XXXX in that exact amount. I didn't agree to that, but there were my digital initials on the form which I knew I never signed. I reached out to the representative immediately and said that's not what I agreed to. In his text message he agreed that this was his understanding and that he would have someone from the company to reach out to me. That never happened and I continued to try and contact someone. When I called XXXX, they said it was through a third party so they couldn't do anything. XXXX XXXX would not respond via phone or email. When I tried to email XXXX, they blocked me. I filed a complaint through the XXXX and they continued to say I signed the form to purchase from XXXX ... when in fact I did not. They continue to reference the contract language to deflect any responsibility, but all they had to do was refund my money. I have never used their service, and I even declined free items when offered stating I just wanted to liquidate my timeshare. When I tried to retrieve the history from the XXXX, it was blank forms.

The ATM would not accept the check. I tried again at the next ATM, the same outcome. This experience is unfair as I am aware of several other members who have been able to utilize the ATM and mobile deposit features for amounts way larger. Additionally, the mobile deposit feature has been heavily advertised by the credit union. My check not being accepted is disparate impact and treatment. The payroll check was {$3100.00}.

Friday morning I woke up to an email from NFCU stating my funds would be delayed an additional XXXX business days, as they had confidential information indicating the check may not be paid giving the them reasonable cause to believe the check would be uncollectible.

I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the actions of State Employees Credit Union ( SECU ) in relation to my account ( XXXX ) and their failure to provide necessary documentation, as well as their wrongful reporting practices, which have had severe consequences on my financial stability and well-being. 

According to Section 15 USC 1681 ( g ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), consumers have the right to request and receive a copy of any XXXX forms for XXXX debts. Despite repeated requests to SECU, I have not received the required XXXX forms for the charge off ( XXXX ) associated with my account ( XXXX ). This failure to provide essential documentation has left me in a precarious financial situation, impacting my ability to provide for my family and jeopardizing our well-being. 

Furthermore, under Section 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( XXXX ) of the FCRA, creditors are obligated to provide accurate information to credit reporting agencies. However, SECU has wrongfully reported these charge off accounts, which have had a detrimental effect on my XXXX XXXX and financial standing. This inaccurate reporting has exacerbated the challenges I face in maintaining my financial stability and has hindered my ability to access necessary credit and resources. 

Additionally, I have submitted disputes regarding these fraudulent accounts to SECU. However, despite my efforts to rectify the situation, SECU has continued to report these disputed accounts, further damaging my XXXX XXXX and exacerbating my financial hardships. According to FCRA regulations, reporting on disputed accounts should be suspended until the dispute is resolved, yet SECU has disregarded this requirement, causing significant harm to my financial well-being.

Therefore, I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate these violations of the FCRA by SECU and take appropriate action to ensure that my rights as a consumer are upheld. Specifically, I request that SECU be compelled to provide the necessary XXXX forms for the charge off ( XXXX ) in question and that the wrongfully reported accounts be removed from my credit report immediately. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will take swift and decisive action to address these violations and protect consumers like myself from unjust and harmful practices by financial institutions.",None,STATE EMPLOYEES CREDIT UNION,NC,275XX,None,Consent provided,Web,05/06/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8941966

Over the past few months, I have received multiple unsolicited calls from a number associated with these organizations. On each occasion, the callers have been reticent about their identities and their company 's purpose. This includes not properly identifying themselves, abruptly ending the call when asked for identification, and insisting on personal confirmation before disclosing any information. 

Specifically, the dates and times of the calls are as follows : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX All but the last were unanswered as I was unable to while working.

I inquired about how to remove this from my credit report, but was informed that even if I paid in full, XXXX XXXX XXXX would not remove the mark from my credit history, only label it as "" paid in full. '' There are inconsistencies with the debt amount these companies claim I owe.

Despite multiple attempts to communicate my situation to Navy Federal, I have been met with a lack of understanding and cooperation, leading to undue financial hardship on my part. 

I have diligently explained to Navy Federal that I was on XXXX XXXXXXXX leave from work and only recently returned to work on XX/XX/XXXX. In light of my financial circumstances, I reached out to Navy Federal 's personal finance team to request an extension for my two auto loans. Initially, in XXXX, I was informed that both loans would qualify for a two-month extension after making my payments. However, when I followed up on this agreement, it was arbitrarily downgraded to a one-month extension without my consent. 

This unilateral decision by XXXX XXXX felt like a bait-and-switch tactic, leaving me feeling deceived and manipulated. I made it clear that the two-month extension was crucial for me to catch up on my auto loan payments, especially given that I was awaiting payments from my long-term leave company, XXXX, which were pending then and remain pending now.

Despite my genuine efforts to negotiate a reasonable solution that aligned with my financial constraints, Navy Federal 's representative insisted that I either accept the one-month extension or receive no extension at all. Feeling pressured and cornered into an agreement that I knew I could not uphold, I reluctantly agreed to the one-month extension, knowing that it would not provide me with adequate time to receive my long-term benefits and catch up on my bills.

As a responsible individual committed to meeting my financial obligations, the treatment I have received from Navy Federal has been distressing and burdensome. This denial of a fair and reasonable extension has significantly impacted my ability to prevent homelessness and provide for my family 's basic needs.

I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter thoroughly and hold Navy Federal accountable for their unfair and deceptive practices. I seek a resolution that is just and equitable, considering the financial hardship and emotional distress that I have endured due to Navy Federal 's actions.

The VERVE card continued to receive money with a hold placed on it and no one knew why and stated that they asked for the hold to be lifted. The hold is still on it after being requested to be removed over two days before I filed the complaint. I was told that the hold takes 24 hours to be released and it has been longer than 24 hours.

11/02/23,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"I have been an account holder for over a decade. I have always paid my bill as agreed, which is due monthly on the XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to pay my bill online as I do every month. I noticed that instead of the ~ $ XXXX bill I was planning to pay towards, the bill was over $ XXXX, and immediately began to research the charges on the account. I observed that on XX/XX/XXXX, a {$2.00} charge was made at a local XXXX, and on XX/XX/XXXX a {$7200.00} cash advance was made at a branch. I navigated to the websites fraud claim reporting system and immediately reported the fraudulent activity, since neither of the charges were authorized by me. The bank removed the charges and began their investigation. In the interim, I discovered that the charges were made on the card that belongs to my authorized user, who is my nephew. Since my authorized user was out of town at the time of the charges due to being in a training camp, after speaking with him, and confirming he had never used nor received the card, I questioned my brother, who has the same name as my authorized user. My brother straightway indicated that he had gone into both the XXXX and the branch and had in fact made the charges on what he believed to be HIS card. He indicated that he had previously applied for a card with the same institution and was under the impression that the card he was using was his. He further stated that he went into the branch with his own ID and was never questioned about his identity. Until I mentioned the situation with my card and my authorized user, he still was under the impression that he was in possession of his own card. The bank subsequently reversed the credit and put both charges plus interest back on my card. 

I informed the bank that they did not verify the party at the branch, because had they done so, they would have realized that although the party has the same first and last name, their date of birth is not the same. I told the XXXX on XXXX of many phone calls made to the institution, that they made a mistake and gave a huge cash advance to a non-authorized party against my account. They refused to own up to their mistake, and instead accused myself and my authorized user of sending the wrong party into the branch to make a cash advance. They are now not only charging me for their mistaken {$7200.00} cash advance, but also the interest involved, which is very expensive. I have been going back and forth with the institution for several months, and they refuse to acknowledge their error. Both parties have the same first and last name, but my authorized user is solely my nephew and not my brother. Their date of birth is very similar. The one being XX/XX/XXXX ( which is my authorized users dob ) and the other being XX/XX/XXXX ( which is my brothers XXXX ). They did not follow sound "" know your customer '' procedures, and as a result, they put my account, and my finances in jeopardy, and are creating a severe hardship for me in keeping up with the much higher payments associated with these unauthorized charges. The bank needs to be held accountable for their error and not charge me, a long-standing customer with their mistake. They are now reporting this higher balance to the bureaus after being made aware of their mistake. They refuse to acknowledge, and now with the higher balance on this credit card, my score has dropped XXXX points. This is a violation of my rights as a consumer, and a violation of accurate reporting. Please help me with this egregious treatment.

******************************************************************************* Can a debt collector take my federal benefits, like Social Security or VA payments? 

Before a debt collector can take Social Security or VA benefits, they must sue you and win a judgment against you for the amount you owe. Then, the debt collector must get a court order that tells your bank or credit union to turn over money from your account or prepaid card. This is called garnishment. 

The key to making sure your federal benefits are legally protected from being frozen or garnished is to use direct deposit to put the money into your account or prepaid card. You can sign up anytime to have federal benefits direct deposited to your bank account or loaded onto a prepaid card. 

As long as I am using direct deposit, which federal benefits are protected? 
Money you receive and direct deposit to your account or card from the following government programs is protected : Social Security benefits Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) benefits Veterans benefits Civil service and federal retirement and XXXX benefits Servicemember pay Military annuities and survivor benefits Federal student aid Railroad retirement benefits Financial assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) ********************************************* XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I am requesting all correspondences be submitted to CFPB ONLY Do not call or Write.

I was informed at the time of request that I would be granted the deferment of payment and that I must make two payments in order to have payment extension request approved. I was informed to contact in XX/XX/XXXX, to make sure request was approved. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice that my auto loan was reporting on my credit report as late payment due to not making my XXXX on time. During the call of request, I was never given any insight of the consequences for a deferment of payment or requesting. I reached out to complain to SECU in which they stated the information was reported correctly and they will make sure to have agents report that information to their account holders. I asked to speak with Manager over the loan department in which XXXX XXXX tried her best to get the Vice president of the bank to reconcile and remove the negative derogatory mark on my credit. He denied and wasn't interested in the fact I was a great client. I also reached out to the Vice president of SECU myself and was told it was nothing he could do about removing the late payment from my account. I think as a consumer of this bank, I should have been informed that if I was to request an extension that my credit score would be affected and allowed me to determine if I wanted to subject my credit to display derogatory remarks. I do believe I was denied due to racial discrimination as it was the fault of the agent who only provided the Pros of the extension and not the Cons of the request for extension. Instead of treating a committed consumer who never is late with payments, I should have been given notice of what affects this could do to my credit score. I have now been denied due to false information being reported from the SECU. I have asked for a one time courtesy to remove the late payment due to the error on the bank behalf as I should have been informed. My car payments are deducted by auto pay and the bank had to process a stop payment to not draft the payment from my account. If I was informed of the negative affect, I would have not asked SECU to stop payment from my automatic payment. I have been denied and unable to purchase or look at homes due to this false report on my credit report.

01/08/24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Application denials,"On XX/XX/XXXX, my XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) & I applied for a mortgage online on their website. The loan number assigned was # XXXX. We received an automated email & later received an email from XXXX XXXX explaining the process. During our application process, I uploaded letters explaining our situation regarding jobs, child support, etc. XXXX never said anything about what I uploaded. She simply referred our application to underwriting. I don't even think she read any of the attachments or I am sure she would've asked for clarification before sending to UW as a prudent worker would. 

I was then shocked to receive 2 denial package emails on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX  saying the wrong denial reasons for me. This complaint is only about my part of the application because I can't speak for XXXX 's credit. 

The denial letters indicate the 2  principal reasons for my denial as : 1. Delinquent past or present obligations & 2. Excessive obligations in relation to income. This is why I am complaining. 

# 1 - My credit is excellent. I do NOT have a single delinquency, judgment, or collection on my credit reports. So, they are clearly referring to someone else. That reason does no refer to my credit profile at all. I have almost an XXXX credit score. What delinquency are they thinking they are seeing? I only use 2 % of my credit limit on top of that. So, this is a complete lie! 

# 2 - I do not have excessive obligations in relation to my income. The only debt I have is student loan debt which normally my monthly obligation is {$0.00} per month on the Income Based Repayment Plan but now it is around {$110.00} mo ( they should be using what my loan servicer requires me to pay ; not some made up amount that they come up with based upon the balance of my student loans when I will eventually be using the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  program ), a personal loan with XXXX with a payment of {$1200.00} mo., a XXXX XXXX car loan for XXXX mo, & a small balance on my XXXX credit card. I was never told my options should I pay off my credit card and car. They just denied me using someone else 's credit profile. I thought underwriting would normally give a customer their options before just kicking them to the curb, but I guess not. I could see if my credit was as they indicated, but it is the polar opposite which is why this is so disturbing to me. 

# 3 - On their denial notice, they listed my credit score as XXXX, which was even lower than my XXXX app showed when I applied. They listed that the reason my score was this amount was because of : Too Many Accounts with Balances ( untrue ), Too Many Inquiries Last 12 Months ( untrue ), Too Many Accounts Recently Opened ( untrue - literally only have 1 or 2 new accounts which are the personal and auto loan. The auto loan is almost paid off. ), Ratio of Balance To Limit On Bank Revolving Or Other Rev Accounts Too High ( untrue - My balances are EXTREMELY low on my revolving accounts. I use about 2 % of my available credit. So, I do not understand this! ) I have worked so hard to have excellent credit & to have XXXX XXXX deny me for reasons that don't apply to my credit profile is very disturbing. I pay all of my debt on time, and I shouldn't be penalized for anyone else 's credit issues. 

# 4 - The last issue that I have is when I went through their application process online, it never said that they'd be pulling my credit from multiple credit report agencies. I only applied for a prequalification to see where we stood in attempting to purchase a home together. I just found out that they pulled my credit with XXXX AND XXXX. The 2 denial notices they emailed me on XX/XX/XXXX indicated that they only pulled XXXX. I didn't give them permission to pull from everywhere just for them to still get my credit score wrong & deny me for a reason that doesn't apply to what they are even looking at for me. They need to delete that XXXX inquiry! The documents I reviewed and electronically signed did not say that they would be pulling from multiple companies. They are not transparent & this is unethical. 

This entire process has been a nightmare because they get you to go through the entire process, pull your credit, and THEN require you to pay almost {$45.00} to continue going through the process. Had I known they were going to use someone else 's credit report information after pulling mine twice and still deny me, I would've never paid them. Then to send me 2 emails at XXXX XXXX  & XXXX XXXX  makes me believe that someone was working the overnight shift and was tired which caused them to make that huge mistake on our application. 

When I decide to go through this process again, I will definitely not go through NFCU.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,NC,27545,None,Consent provided,Web,01/08/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8121628

I have operated in good faith and will continue to do so. I expect Navy Federal Credit Union to demonstrate the same courtesy. Im going to take the time to educate Navy Federal Credit Union on consumer laws since Navy Federal Credit Union is causing me direct harm as well as violating federal laws. According to 15 USC 1681a ( f ), the term consumer reporting agency means any person who, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties, and who uses any means or facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing consumer reports.

XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX are third parties due to the simple fact that they are separate entities from I the consumer and Navy Federal Credit Union. Furthermore, since Navy Federal Credit Union is federally categorized as a credit reporting agency under 15 USC 1681a ( f ), my written instructions as the consumer must be followed without further delay.

Furthermore, now that I have educated Navy Federal Credit Union on its proper legal role as a consumer reporting agency under 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ), Navy Federal Credit Union has to launch an investigation into my dispute and disclose the results of the investigation no later than 30 days from receipt of this complaint. Failure to launch an investigation and follow my written instruction will be willful non-compliance under 15 U.S.C. 1681n ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), and under this provision, I am entitled to {$1000.00} per violation.

Specifically, NFCUs role as Attorney-in-Fact, security interests or NFCU receiving proceeds, that the signed promissory note would be securitized and converted into a negotiable instrument.

NFCU violated the debtors privacy by reporting her personal information to a third party without written permission from her. ( Privacy Act of 1974 ).

On my banking app it shows the card still there, shows the balance left and the credit limit but is not being translated to my credit score.

When I pulled my report this year I looked at my account and it was marked as closed and not a single payment has been reported. The only reported item is the balance owed and not the credit limit. I did not close this account and this account has been in good standing the 7 years I've had the card.

When I called NFCU they told me that their system chooses accounts that have little to no use on it and they close it. With the system doing this it no longer reports my accurate credit card limit but reports the balance of the credit card. This has had my credit usage on my credit report up and over 150 % for over a year! 

They told me that there is nothing they can do even though they are falsely reporting my credit. Since the call my credit has reported a XXXX pt drop and I feel as if the institution is falsely reporting more information.

I applied for a personal loan on XX/XX/23 on Navy Federal Credit Union 's website. I keep my credit reports frozen, so I lifted the freeze just to apply for this loan. I asked for $ XXXX, but was counteroffered $ XXXX on XX/XX/23 online. 

Before declining their offer, I decided that I wanted to apply for an auto loan instead to pay off my XXXX XXXX XXXX. So, I emailed XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/23 asking if I did this, would they be pulling my credit again because I didn't want them to. They responded with a vague answer that it was up to the discretion of their lending department but they couldn't guarantee that they wouldn't pull it again. At this point, my credit reports were frozen again. 

So, I declined their personal loan offer on XX/XX/23 & went ahead and applied for the auto loan. Again, I emailed them asking them whether or not they'd have to pull my credit when they just did so on XX/XX/23. The response I got today, XX/XX/23, was the same vague one they sent me before. Then, they said I could call customer service and follow the prompts to the lending department after I asked for a lending manager to call me. 

So, I called XXXX at XXXX XXXX & eventually spoke to XXXX once their automated system called me back. They had a lot of customers ahead of me. I explained the situation to XXXX & he said that he didn't understand why customer service didn't just explain that the first report they pulled on XX/XX/23 was for a non-collateral personal loan. The report they tried to pull yesterday from the same credit reporting agency ( XXXX ) was for a collateral loan, and it's just their policy to pull it again. It doesn't make sense, but that's their policy. 

When I emailed them earlier today, I emailed my credit score along with proof that they already pulled my credit 3 days ago. My credit hasn't changed in 3 days & the vague email response just keeps stating that it's up to "" their discretion '' whether or not they will use my XX/XX/23 credit report. If it's up to their discretion, then they are saying that they have the ability to use the report that they already have in their possession to make their decision on my auto loan application if they choose to. Them trying to pull it again yesterday would've caused me to lose more points from my score had my report not been frozen, and that's not okay with me. 

When I asked to speak to a manager earlier today, I wasn't given that opportunity. I'd like to apply for this loan with them, but I will go to XXXX, if necessary.

Despite my initial communication, I have not received a satisfactory response nor have I seen any corrective action taken regarding this matter. 

As previously stated, XXXX has been reporting a charge off on my accounts without providing the requisite Form 1099-C as mandated by law. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), it is explicitly prohibited to report income on my credit report without adhering to the necessary legal procedures. This oversight not only represents a violation of my rights but also casts a shadow on my creditworthiness unfairly. 

Furthermore, I wish to reiterate that these accounts are currently under dispute. As per the guidelines outlined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), any accounts under dispute should not be reported until the investigation is completed and a resolution is reached. Yet, despite the ongoing dispute, these accounts continue to be reflected on my credit report, causing undue distress and financial harm. 

I am deeply concerned about the disregard for consumer rights demonstrated by XXXX in handling this matter. The failure to address my grievances promptly and accurately reflects poorly on XXXX 's commitment to fair and transparent practices. 

Therefore, I urge XXXX to take immediate action to rectify this situation. Specifically, I request the removal of the accounts associated with SECU from my credit report until the dispute is resolved satisfactorily and the provision of the necessary documentation, including the Form 1099-C, as required by law. 

I expect a prompt response to this letter and a resolution to be reached without further delay. Failure to do so will leave me with no choice but to explore all available legal avenues to protect my rights and seek appropriate redress.

GM Financial has been reporting my loan/account with their company for the leasing of my XXXX XXXX XXXX as a repossession since XXXX XXXX. My account has not been in repossession status since XXXX XXXX. On the day in question, I woke up at XXXX XXXX  and discovered my car was gone, within 4 hours my car balance was paid in full and I was able to obtain my car from the tow yard. At the moment the car payment was made, and the car was taken out of repossession status it should have been accurately reported to the credit bureau within 30 days. 

They are continuing to report inaccurately. This is a violation of my consumer credit rights. I called GM Financial in XXXX to report to them that the inaccuracies were still being reported and the customer service team provided me with incorrect information and false validation to me that the situation would be handled. After being denied credit cards, loan applications, and mortgage applications I finally did some deep diving into my credit report and to my surprise discovered this fallacy that has been going on for almost 7 months.

04/16/24,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction problem,None,"I am writing to formally lodge a complaint against Navy Federal Credit Union concerning an unauthorized transaction and a fraudulent loan application made using my identity, which directly violates the Electronic Funds Transfer Act ( EFTA ) and Regulation E ( 12 CFR Part 1005 ).

The Electronic Funds Transfer Act ( EFTA ), codified at 15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r, was enacted to provide a basic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic funds transfer systems. The primary goal of the EFTA is to protect consumers engaging in electronic transfers, including ATM withdrawals, direct deposits, and transfers for bill payments.

12 CFR Part 1005, commonly referred to as Regulation E, implements the EFTA and sets forth the rules that financial institutions must follow regarding electronic funds transfers ( EFTs ). It provides guidelines to protect consumers when they use electronic systems to transfer money and outlines the procedures for resolving errors on accounts. 


**Incident Description : ** - On XX/XX/XXXX, a loan application was forged in my name for {$3900.00} ( Reference Number : XXXX ). 
- Simultaneously, an unauthorized transfer of {$4900.00} was made from my account. 
- Navy Federal was notified within XXXX minutes of the incident. Despite providing all requested documentation, including a Declaration of Forgery/Fraud, my claims have been repeatedly denied, with the focus solely on the transfer and not on the fraudulent loan application and the associated events surrounding these transactions. 

**Violations and Concerns** XXXX. **Non-Compliance with EFTA and Regulation E** : Navy Federal failed to adhere to the liability limitations and notification requirements under Regulation E, which mandates specific responsibilities for financial institutions in the case of unauthorized transfers.

2. **Failure to Protect Consumer Rights under EFTA/Regulation E** : Navy Federal has not fulfilled its obligations to limit my liability for unauthorized electronic fund transfers and to conduct a comprehensive investigation.

3. **Inadequate Fraud Handling Procedures** : The process and response to my fraud alerts and claim submissions have been grossly inadequate, highlighting potential systemic issues within Navy Federals fraud management practices. 

XXXX. **Unauthorized Inquiry and Adverse Impact on Consumer Report** : An unauthorized credit inquiry was made on XX/XX/XXXX as part of a fraudulent loan application ( Reference Number : XXXX ) forged in my name. This inquiry has been recorded on my consumer report and has had an adverse and unfair impact on my XXXX XXXX. Unauthorized inquiries can decrease a consumer 's credit score and are detrimental to one 's financial health and ability to secure future credit under fair terms. 

The presence of this inquiry, linked to fraudulent activities not instigated nor authorized by me, directly contravenes the principles of accurate and fair credit reporting as stipulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). It is imperative that such inaccuracies are corrected promptly to mitigate any further negative impact on my financial reputation and creditworthiness. 

**Key Provisions and Violations under EFTA and Regulation E** 1. Error Resolution Procedures ( 12 CFR 1005.11 ) : Financial institutions are required to investigate errors reported by consumers regarding electronic funds transfers on their account statements. The institution must complete its investigation within specific time frames and correct any error promptly.

Violation : NFCU Failed to investigate or resolve errors as required which lead to liability for the resulting damages to the me as the consumer.

2. Liability of Consumer for Unauthorized Transfers ( 12 CFR 1005.6 ) : Limits the amount a consumer can be held liable for in cases of lost or stolen access devices, such as debit cards, provided the consumer notifies the institution within specified timeframes.

Violation : NFCU failed to limit my liability as the consumer as stipulated, it may be required to refund the unauthorized amounts and may be subject to additional damages. 

XXXX. Initial Disclosures ( 12 CFR 1005.7 ) : Institutions must provide detailed disclosures before a consumer agrees to participate in an EFT service. Disclosures should include conditions of the service, fees, liability rules, and error resolution processes. 
Violation : NFCUs lack of adequate disclosure calls for adminstrative enforcement actions and the requirement to make restitution to me as the affected consumer. 



**Additional Concerns Over Denial Decision** The denial of my claims by Navy Federal Credit Union not only exacerbates the financial distress caused by the unauthorized transactions but also fundamentally undermines the principles of fairness, equity, and the fiduciary relationship expected between a financial institution and its depositors. As a holder of an account insured by the National Credit Union Administration ( NCUA ), I believed in a guaranteed level of protection and fiduciary care that has been conspicuously absent in this instance.

3. **Breach of Fiduciary Duty** : Navy Federal 's decision to deny the claim disregards the duty of prudence, care, and loyalty owed to me as a depositor. The swift notification of the fraudulent activities was met with inadequate and dismissive responses, failing to uphold the trust placed in them by their members. 

XXXX. **Fiduciary Duty Neglected** : The handling of my fraud claim demonstrates a neglect of these fiduciary duties. The lack of a thorough investigation into the unauthorized transactions the subsequent denial of my claims without substantial justification suggests that Navy Federal has not acted with the required level of care and diligence.

5. **Conflict of Interest** : The handling of my case suggests a potential conflict of interest, where the financial institutions procedures for fraud prevention and claim resolution may unduly favor minimizing their financial exposure over protecting consumers, depositors, and beneficial owners ' interests. Such a conflict is detrimental to the trust and safety expected in banking relations. This raises serious concerns about the internal practices and protocols of Navy Federal, particularly regarding the impartiality and integrity of the fraud management process.

6. **Violation of Equitable Indemnity Principles** : The concept of equitable indemnity, where losses should be shifted based on the relationship between the parties and not merely contractual obligations, should compel Navy Federal to accept responsibility for the losses incurred as a result of unauthorized access and transactions. Their failure to do so defies the principles of equitable treatment, which are critical in financial governance.

7. **Equitable Indemnity and NCUA Insurance** : Furthermore, my account with Access Number XXXX is insured by the NCUA, which is designed to protect against losses like those I have encountered. The failure to apply the principles of equitable indemnity in this situationwhere the loss should shift from me to the institution based on our relationship, not on the intent or fault of the parties involveddefies the purpose of such insurance. The denial of my claim prevents me from benefiting from this protection, effectively denying me the equitable relief I am entitled to under the circumstances.

Given these serious concerns, it is imperative that the CFPB conduct a comprehensive review not only of the specific incidents but also of Navy Federals overall approach to handling such sensitive matters. It is essential that corrective measures are implemented to restore confidence and ensure that statutory as well as ethical obligations towards consumers are rigorously upheld. I urge the CFPB to consider these points seriously and to provide the necessary equitable relief to rectify the financial and emotional harm inflicted upon me through no fault of my own. Your intervention is crucial in not only addressing this individual case but in reinforcing the integrity of the credit union system at large. 

**Liability and Enforcement** Civil Liability ( 15 U.S.C. 1693m ) : Consumers may recover actual damages and in some cases additional statutory damages for violations. The law also provides for the recovery of attorney 's fees and court costs. A class action lawsuit may be filed for statutory damages for each named plaintiff and for the class, subject to a cap.

Administrative Enforcement : The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) is primarily responsible for enforcing Regulation E. State Attorney Generals may also enforce the provisions of the EFTA and Regulation E.

It has unequivocally come to my attention that NAVY FCU has engaged in unauthorized reporting to my credit report without obtaining my explicit consent. Federal law, as outlined in the FCRA, explicitly mandates that the consent of the consumer is a non-negotiable requirement for such reporting activities under Section 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ).

In addition to federal law, North Carolina state law, specifically N.C.G.S. 75-61 and 75-62, emphasizes the necessity of consumer consent for credit reporting. Furthermore, North Carolina Identity Theft Protection Act establishes clear guidelines for the fair reporting and protection of consumer credit information. Identity fraud laws in North Carolina underscore the severity of unauthorized access and misuse of personal information. 

I assert with unwavering certainty that I have not provided consent for NAVY FCU to report any information to my credit report. This undeniable lack of explicit permission constitutes a blatant violation of my rights, resulting in potential damage to my creditworthiness and an unequivocal disregard for federal and state laws. 

I demand, with the utmost certainty, that NAVY FCU immediately ceases any further reporting of information to my credit report without obtaining my explicit consent, as mandated by Section 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA and applicable North Carolina statutes. Failure to comply within the stipulated 30-day timeframe will be viewed as willful noncompliance, subject to penalties under applicable laws, including identity fraud laws. 

I emphasize that obtaining consent is not a discretionary choice but a legal obligation under these specific sections of the FCRA and North Carolina state law. This is not a negotiation ; it is a demand for compliance with both federal and state regulations, protecting consumers like myself from unauthorized and damaging credit reporting. 

I anticipate your immediate attention to this matter and expect that NAVY FCU will promptly rectify these egregious violations, respecting my rights under federal and state laws.

One of the debts he listed on his bankruptcy application was a master card account that my estranged husband and I were joint credit card holders. 

On or about XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I received a telephone call from a lady from the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX Bankruptcy department demanding payment. She spoke in a rude and very abrasive tone of voice demanding payment. 

She went on to say that just because my husband filed for bankruptcy that I am still liable to pay the credit card bill and that I need to make an immediate payment. I made a payment that day and subsequently set up an automatic payment from my checking account for {$36.00} to pay the credit card bill every month. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX Florida Bankruptcy court notified RBFCU Mastercard bankruptcy department to file any claims they may have by submitting Proof of Claims due to the Bankruptcy XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX, Randolph Brooks FCU Mastercard bankruptcy department submitted their Proof of Claim for {$1700.00} for the joint credit card account to the XXXX XXXX  Bankruptcy XXXX. Note : as of XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, {$1700.00} was the joint credit card account balance. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX XXXX  bankruptcy court sent Randolph Brooks FCU Mastercard bankruptcy department check # XXXX for {$1800.00} ( {$1700.00} payment in full for the joint credit card account claim and {$2.00} interest ).

Unbeknown to me that the bankruptcy court had paid the claim in full and that RBFCU had transferred the balance to a new account and was still taking payment from my checking account.

I recently found out that the Bankruptcy court had paid RBFCU the claim in full plus interest ( {$1800.00} ), On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed RBFCU requesting to be reimburse the overpayment of $ XXXXand to correct my credit reports and to stop taking payment from my checking account. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, RBFCU responded back to my complaint, but they only reimbursed me {$250.00}. That means RBFCU collected a total of {$230000.00} for a claim they submitted for only {$1700.00} ( my payments of {$820.00} and the Bankruptcy court payment of {$1800.00} ). I strongly believe this is fraud and I should be reimbursed the total overpayment of {$820.00} and not just {$250.00}.

Despite adhering to the timelines and providing all necessary documentation as outlined in NFCU 's Zero Liability Policy Agreement, my dispute was unjustly denied.

We'll investigate your fraud claim on your behalf and issue you a provisional credit. '' Similarly, XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX policy provides protection for unauthorized transactions and emphasizes the importance of reporting suspected fraud as soon as possible. 
I firmly believe that NFCU 's decision to deny my dispute is in direct violation of the Zero Liability Agreements and applicable consumer protection laws. I kindly request the CFPB 's assistance in reviewing my case and ensuring that NFCU adheres to its obligations under the Zero Liability Agreements and the relevant consumer protection regulations. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter.

Shortly after the XXXX erroneous transfers were made, I contacted PenFed to alert them to the error and to ensure all future unwanted transfers would be halted.

Your prompt assistance and support in addressing this issue were greatly appreciated, and I commend your team for their professionalism and responsiveness during this challenging time.

The promissory note requires the information below : As promptly as possible and no later than three months, the Applicant/owner ( s ) will deliver to Navy Federal a Certificate of Title or other proof of ownership reflecting Navy Federal as the first lien holder . The Certificate of Title must also show the individual Applicant/owner ( s ) as the registered owner ( s ) of the collateral. Failure to comply with this request can result in Navy Federal converting this loans annual percentage rate to Navy Federals prevailing unsecured personal loan rate and can increase your monthly payment.

If Navy Federal exercises its right to file for the lien-recorded title, filing fees will appear as a debit on the Applicants savings account. 

The boat and trailer are registered and titled in the state of North Carolina. I verified, in XX/XX/2020 with the North Carolina XXXX  Department, who registers and titles boats, that a copy of title with Navy Federal as primary lean holder was sent in 2020. I had a duplicate copy sent to Navy Federal the same day XXXX XXXX. A receipt was emailed to Navy Federal to XXXX as I was instructed to do when I went to a branch office to fix this issue, along with the bill of sale with model and serial for the motor and trailer as well as XXXX for the boat via email on XXXX XXXX. A copy of the NC registration and tax was submitted in same email. 
My rate was corrected for the second time from 16.9 % back to the original 8.9 %. 
My rate was increased again a few months later saying they needed the same information. 

On XXXX at XXXX I called back again attempting to correct. I was informed that they never recieved any title copy from the state of North Carolina. They never recieved any emails from me. They them, after I provided date and time of email as well as each attachment, stated that no attachments were on the email. I forwarded the email back to Navy Federal. I was then told the attachments had to be in PDF format. 
I asked to speak with a supervisor who told I had to provide a copy of the title and US or foreign title or registration for the motor ( which does not exist as the motor is part of the boat ) as well as statement of origin from the manufacturer of the motor. None of this is in the promissory note as above. 
One again I was told they have not recieved anything from myself or the state of North Carolina. 
I have not missed payments. I am up to date on my loan. The information they request is not possible as it does not exist. By law, I can not obtain a copy of the title without authorization by the first lein holder which is Navy Federal, who will not authorize me to obtain. I was told no email correspondence is allowed by Navy Federal when i requested a copy of the note saying i had to provide a foreign title or registration or certificate of orgin fir the motor, so they will not provide anything to me in writing via email stating what is needed to clear this up. Each time I have sent information in the rate has been adjusted back down then raised months later. This is criminal fraud by Navy federal as I have provided and the state of North Carolina has provided the title with Navy Federal as first lein holder. 
I have a second personal loan for a golf cart that the same thing has happened with as well. The original rate was raised after purchase. The cart has no XXXX  # as it is does not exist and can not be registered. A bill of sale was provided with model and serial. The rate lowered and then raised again.

The problem is that internal departments of NFCU do not interact or communicate the changing status of any one account, in a timely manner. This lack of internal coordination that was admitted to me by an NFCU employee, while on the phone, caused the NFCU to take an additional {$480.00} from my checking account.

The IRS requires that all funds are disbursed out the non spouse inherited ira within 10 years so I decided that I will begin taking disbursement on year 7 after the cd matures. I called penfed in response to a letter about ira tax withholdings I received from them. They said they are requiring me to take a distribution each year in equal payments for 10 years. I told them that I would like to wait a few years after my cd matures to take distribution. Apparently this is a penfed rule that was not explained nor written anywhere in my documents I received from them. And if thats their rules, thats fine but I should have been given some type of notice about it. I immediately requested to transfer funds to a different financial institution that will allow me to take funds out at anytime as long as the account is depleted by the 10th year per IRS guidelines. Penfed said that I would lose all interest if I transfer money out of the account before maturity but they can withdraw funds each year out of my account before maturity as a distribution. It was not explained to me that penfed could take funds out my account before maturity for distribution even though it is not required until the 10th year. They also said they will send me a letter explaining this but I should have received a letter about when opening the account. It is not my wishes to transfer to another financial institution but the deceptive practice of withdrawing money out my cd because of a penfed rule is extremely unfair and I shouldnt pay penalty fees.

- On the XXXX XXXX XXXX  web site, it is stated that that ACHs take at least 1 and possibly 4 days to process. I notified NFCU in less than a day.

She looked through my case and said that there was no record of my protest nor my request for the documentation. She indicated that that request had to be in writing although nowhere on their XX/XX/ letter is that requirement stated. So, I wrote to request for my right to analyze their investigation. That letter went through the NFCU website to save a few days in the mail. I was told to expect a reply in 2 business days. 

- On XX/XX/ I received their response. They again denied my protest, and purposely refused to provide any information regarding their investigation.

05/02/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a deeply troubling issue that has recently arisen concerning my application for a credit card with the North Carolina State Employees ' Credit Union ( NCSECU ). 

As a dedicated member of NCSECU for over two decades, I have consistently demonstrated my commitment to financial responsibility and integrity. Throughout this time, I have diligently repaid every loan extended to me by NCSECU, and I have successfully paid off a previous credit card issued by the institution. Additionally, I maintain a flawless payment history on my existing credit card, which has never once been late.

Despite my long-standing loyalty and exemplary financial track record, I was shocked to receive a denial for my credit card application. What troubles me deeply is the apparent discrepancy in treatment, as individuals with comparable credit scores have been approved for credit cards by NCSECU while I have been denied.

Moreover, as someone deeply entrenched in the finance industry, specifically serving as a finance director at a reputable dealership, I have witnessed NCSECU approving loans exceeding {$10000.00} for individuals with credit histories far less favorable than mine. This inconsistency raises serious concerns regarding fairness and equity in NCSECU 's lending practices.

It is disheartening to believe that my application may have been denied based on factors beyond my control, particularly when my record of financial responsibility and loyalty to NCSECU speaks volumes.

I implore NCSECU to conduct a thorough review of my credit card application, taking into account my extensive history with the institution, impeccable repayment track record, and current credit standing. I firmly believe that these factors warrant a reconsideration of the initial decision.

I stand ready to provide any additional documentation or information that may assist in the review process. Furthermore, I am more than willing to engage in open dialogue to address any concerns or questions NCSECU may have regarding my application.

I trust that NCSECU shares my commitment to fairness and equity in its lending practices and will take prompt and decisive action to rectify this situation.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I eagerly await a favorable resolution and the opportunity to continue my positive relationship with NCSECU.",None,STATE EMPLOYEES CREDIT UNION,NC,27530,None,Consent provided,Web,05/02/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8914190

Before the charge off of my debt, it was agreed upon that the debt would be paid in full, and that my credit report would not be impacted negatively. However, the creditor did not honor this agreement, and their violation of FCRA has negatively impacted my ability to obtain credit. 

According to the FCRA, creditors have a responsibility to report accurate information to the credit bureaus. In this case, the creditor broke our agreement, thereby violating the FCRA, which has caused damage to my credit score and limited my ability to obtain credit. 

I request an investigation into this matter, and I ask that the Creditor be held accountable for their violation of the FCRA. Additionally, I urge that you take necessary measures to ensure that the creditor corrects the inaccurate reporting on my credit report, and provides compensation for the damages they have inflicted upon me. 

I appreciate your attention and assistance in this matter, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding a resolution.

07/02/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"I am writing to seek your assistance regarding a credit card fraud claim dispute with Navy Federal Credit Union. Despite my efforts to resolve the issue directly with the institution, I have been unable to reach a satisfactory resolution. I would greatly appreciate your help in addressing the matter outlined below : On XX/XX/year>, I logged into my Navy Federal account and discovered three unauthorized charges : two transactions from the XXXX XXXX totaling {$2600.00} and one transaction from XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$640.00}. I immediately contacted Navy Federal to report these unauthorized charges. 

Nearly a month later, on XX/XX/year>, Navy Federal issued a temporary credit to my account while they investigated the matter. However, on XX/XX/year>, Navy Federal reversed the credit, stating that their investigation concluded that I had conducted these transactions. I must emphasize that I have never visited an XXXX XXXX or a XXXX XXXX XXXX store, and my card was in my possession at all times during the period in question. 

I believe the initial investigation conducted by Navy Federal did not accurately reflect the circumstances of the case. To clarify, here are the key points that support my claim : Store Visits : I have never been to an Apple Store or a XXXX XXXX XXXX store. Given the size and reputation of these stores, it is likely that they have security cameras that could verify whether I made these purchases. 

Card Possession : My card was in my possession at all times. It was neither lost nor stolen, and I did not authorize anyone else to use it. 

Immediate Reporting : Upon discovering the unauthorized transactions, I promptly reported them to Navy Federal, which resulted in the initial issuance of a temporary credit.

Reversal of Credit : The reversal of the temporary credit without concrete evidence that I made these purchases is concerning. Navy Federals conclusion seems to be based on incomplete or incorrect information. 

Given these points, I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assist in facilitating a thorough and impartial review of my fraud claim by Navy Federal. I believe that a fair reassessment of the evidence will demonstrate that I did not authorize these transactions.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,NC,28303,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,07/02/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,9408118

( 1 ) In general.The term consumer report means any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer 's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumers eligibility for ( A ) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes ; ( B ) employment purposes ; or ( C ) any other purpose authorized under section 1681b of this title.

( 2 ) Exclusions.Except as provided in paragraph ( 3 ), the term consumer report does not include ( A ) subject to section 1681s3 of this title, any ( i ) report containing information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report A charge off can only occur when late payments are reported. However, federal law clearly and conspicuously states that reports containing information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report is an exclusion. Do late payments not fall under experiences, which are not supposed to be part of the consumer report? These late payments were reported without authorization and in clear violation of federal law.

A payment may only be treated as late if certain requirements are abided by, one including those of 15 USC 1666 B, labeled under timing of payments. It is stated ; A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

Where is this documentation to validate these late payments that resulted in a charge off? This documentation pursuant of this statute, should have been provided to the credit reporting agencies as well as I, the consumer in order to furnish this information.

I, the consumer, am stating I received no such documentation to validate the late payments being reported.

If it is lucid that late payments are an exclusion, what is the basis of this charge-off? There is no justification for this unlawful action. I demand the immediate deletion of this account from my consumer report.

If this account is not removed within 30 days of your receipt of this letter, I will have grounds to sue. Which will include, but its not limited to ; defamation of character negligent enablement of identity fraud Fair Credit Reporting Acts 15 USC 1681 violations for willful non-compliance and 616 civil liability for willful non-compliance I am fully aware of my consumer rights, and this charge-off was reported in complete disregard of those rights.

10/11/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","I have worked as a XXXX XXXX  for 26 years. Earlier this year I began having severe headaches and many health issues and it led to missing a lot of time from work which caused me to have struggles with my mortgage payment to State Employee Credit Union. I have been a long time customer and have multiple accounts and personal loans with them and thought they would be understanding and work with me when I told them that a XXXX XXXXXXXX was discovered and that I had to undergo XXXX XXXXXXXX to remove it. I spoke with an agent who told me it would be OK and they would work with me on a repayment plan. However while in recovery I received a letter from a law firm telling me that my home was in foreclosure. 
State Employee Credit Union has engaged in unethical servicing practices and has denied access to programs to help homeowners and instead pushed me into foreclosure. They are putting profits over people. I bought my home in XX/XX/XXXX with an {$85000.00} down payment and used SECU because of my long relationship with them. I am extremely disappointed in the way they have handled this situation. 

When I first became ill in XX/XX/XXXX I missed three months of payments. I was back to work and made the XXXX and XXXX payment and then talked with a man in the collections department and we worked out a plan so that I could get caught up by making double payments. I made the double payment for XXXX .I found out in XXXX that I had a XXXX XXXX and required multiple tests and a hastily scheduled XXXX. As a result I was unable to make the XXXX double payment. I spoke to XXXX at SECU in XXXX and explained my situation. She did not disclose or discuss any options for assistance programs instead telling me to apply for the state program. 

Later that month I received a letter from a law firm while I was recovering from XXXX. They told me they were going to foreclose on my home. I called SECU and explained what had happened and told them that I talked to someone in their office and they gave me a plan and this should not be happening. The SECU agent told me that this man no longer worked in that department and that he did not make any notes regarding this plan so they had no evidence of the plan because it was a verbal agreement. The agent continued and said as far as the collections department was concerned, there was nothing in place so they initiated foreclosure. 

On their website SECU says Members can meet face to face with a Senior Financial Services Officer of the Credit Union to develop an individualized financial plan. We are committed to meet with members having problems wherever and whenever to discuss, review and develop a short term repayment plan that works. We want to help members keep their homes.They go on to list Options that may be considered are temporary modification of the payment amount or temporary deferment of monthly payment or modifying the terms of the existing loan None of this happened. None of these options were presented to me. One employee offers help by suggesting I make double payments. A different employee says that help does not exist because they now work in a different department etc. I have worked as a registered nurse for 26 years and have always paid my bills on time. My health situation was unexpected and scary because they were not sure what the problem was. I missed a lot of time from work and used up all of my PTO and that is why I missed my payments. I thought I was getting better and resumed my payments and made an agreement to make double payments and then I got sick again and found out about the XXXX. I was unable to work for two months and had to wait to get approved for short term XXXX which contributed to the financial issues.

I NEVER noticed the money in my account since, at the time, I did NOT check my account every day. Nothing was ever said to me regarding this check by Navy Federal until this year on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX when I presented to Navy Federal that my new Debit Card was NOT working. NOTE : The account in question was cancelled by myself, along with my husband 's checking account due to them changing their cash checking policies for my husband. I opened a NEW checking account on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and so did my husband. We were told to check out new Debit Cards by running a Balance Inquiry to see if they worked and they both did. Then on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I went to use my new debit card for gas, and it was declined. I went right back to Navy Federal and explained the situation. They had me test it on their ATM, to withdraw {$20.00}, and it told me "" Your card is not set up for this type of transaction. '' I then went back to the XXXX  and asked why it said that. She then asked another XXXX to approach and explain what she was seeing on the screen. I was asked if I knew anything about a {$9800.00} fraudulent check put into my account in XXXX. I was shocked at this! We then went back to her office, and she began making phone calls regarding this issue, as they had also just taken the {$220.00}, I had deposited earlier that day, in cash, back out and applied it to this fraudulent check. 
When I returned home, I explained what was going on to my husband. He then began doing some investigating on this issue since it was NOT ME that deposited this check! He found out that the woman on the check XXXX XXXX XXXX went by quite a few different names and lived at a lot of different addresses. The address on the check "" XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, AL XXXX. ***ALSO, one of the addresses she lived at was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX AL XXXX which my husband found out was an XXXX XXXX. It also turns out that this "" XXXX  '' was sold on the same date as the check was written, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 
We are trying to get to the bottom of this because we have NOTHING to hide. I gave all this information to Navy Federal on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and it was submitted electronically to the Headquarters in Virginia. They have accepted my proof but will not talk to me so that I may explain what they are looking at. I was told this when I called on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX when the XXXX 's told me to contact Security after a couple hours of turning in my letter of proof. 
It has now been 3 weeks total, and they are confiscating any monies deposited into my checking account, to the fact of {$3700.00} which was my Federal Income Tax Refund. This is so unfair and after doing more research, Navy Federal is to release my funds "" temporarily '' back to me until their investigation is complete. I found that on the Consumer Protection Agencies website on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 
Please have them release my funds back to me as now my NC State Refund check will be going in soon and they will keep that as well. UNFAIR TO ME AS A CONSUMER! They've already decided I'm guilty without even letting me explain the proof that I had given to them.

02/04/24,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"We were advised by an XXXX XXXX XXXX to make this complaint to the CFPB. 

It is our hope that this complaint toward our banking institution, the NC State Employees Credit Union, gets an them to acknowledge our loss as fraudulent and recognize the their lack of guidance in part as we made a wire transfer in the amount of {$100000.00} last XX/XX/XXXX. 

On our first call to them once we realized we had been victimized we were told the XXXX "" protects their members '' and would work to get our money back. Once we went to the credit union in person to report the crime we followed the credit union officer 's directions to file a police report and wait for a response from the real XXXX XXXX department on a decision to cover the loss. We also filed reports to the Federal Trade Commission and the FBI. 

We waited for weeks and finally were told that by XXXX that our transaction could not be returned to our account because we signed the wire transfer paper. I appealed to the same teller a month or so later and he told me the same but that he would look to see if the money could be recovered under the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX but it was unlikely. I never heard back from him. 

Our main complaint is that the teller should have immediately consulted with a branch manager to meet with us before we made such large wire transfer. That way we would have been able to rethink our decision and the thieves would not have gotten our retirement savings. When it didn't go through the first time and the person posing as a XXXX XXXX  XXXX called us and instructed us to return to the credit union to change the "" beneficiary '' on the wire transfer paper. When we walked in the teller recognized us and said, "" I was just about to call you to come back because the transfer didn't go through. '' At that point we feel like we did not receive the guidance we should have to reconsider the transaction. Instead, we gave him the new beneficiary information provided to us by the thief and it went through. This is when we felt he should have called in a branch manager. 

Below is the statement I provided to the FBI as a narrative of the chain of events that led to the loss of our XXXX XXXX XXXX funds. Now we face a huge tax bill. 

XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : I received an email from XXXX XXXX that looked official stating that an order was ready that I did not make. It was a purchase for XXXX and another for guns. I called the number on the email that stated "" if you did not make this purchase '' please call. I was connected to an "" agent '' for XXXX XXXX who tried to help me but we were disconnected. A different "" agent '' called ( XXXX ) and told me to open an app called XXXX XXXX on my phone. This call also failed so finally a man who identified himself as "" XXXX XXXX '' the "" XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX '' called and asked me to open the application on my desk top. My husband and I did this together. At that time he ran us through several searches to prove to us that we had been hacked and that he would take care of this problem for us. He also gave me figures of other "" pre-authorized '' charges pending on my account. {$1400.00}, {$1800.00}, {$2200.00}, and I had one for {$380.00} on the XXXX XXXX "" invoice ''. 

He had me give him the phone number for the call center for my bank. He said he was going to send them a message and that a someone would get back to me. Within minutes a person identifying himself as "" XXXX XXXX '' called and explained he was from State Employees Credit Union ( my bank ) XXXX department. I questioned the phone number XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX as it was from XXXX and he explained to me that all banks have their XXXX  headquarters in XXXX . He then gave me the exact figures of preauthorized amounts that were pending on my State Employees Credit Union. I emailed the XXXX to put a block on my account and he said that was fine. 

XXXX XXXX also knew the name of my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and told us that someone had made a request to withdraw {$100000.00} and that I would have to make my own request quickly so that the "" hackers '' would not get it. He gave us rules because he said that no one could be trusted and that the hackers could be someone from XXXX XXXX or XXXX. He even asked me if I trusted my XXXX XXXX! The same week I had sent a message to our XXXX XXXX advisor requesting an appointment so this seemed like a possible place the hackers could have gotten in. 
The Rules : Only speak to XXXX XXXX, Don't tell anyone, Can talk to family but only to say the problem was resolved, Can withdraw funds from XXXX but to let him know first. 

After that call "" XXXX '' called me back and told us to keep my phone lines open so they could try to "" catch '' the hackers. This continued for days and hours on my phone and my husband 's phone. Always with sincere concern for my XXXX and promises to have this situation corrected. I continued to follow directions from him and the other person but always questioning their titles and what they were doing. I have over XXXX text messages from them. 

The actual thefts occurred between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX because the XXXX weekend delayed transfer of funds. 

Following XXXX 's directive, I called XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to request our withdrawal of all funds from our retirement funds, XXXX told me to make up a scenario if I was asked why I wanted to withdraw ALL the funds. He said XXXX XXXX or someone at his office could not be trusted. My agent, while taken aback, explained it could not happen until after XXXX. 
So, the following Monday XX/XX/XXXX My husband and I both requested our funds by my cellphone from XXXX XXXX. The funds would be available by Thursday XX/XX/XXXX. In the meantime, my husband 's was on an open line with XXXX. So he heard the requests. The total amount requested was {$110000.00}. XXXX XXXX withheld money for a XXXX for taxes. 

XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX had me open an account with XXXX XXXX ( a digital bank ) while he was on Any Desk on my computer. That afternoon XXXX again gave us specific instructions for wiring the {$10000.00} out of my checking account to XXXX XXXX that he had me open that morning. He made sure that I used the exact name on the account I opened on the wire transfer form and that he wanted to stay on an open line while I was in the bank so he could hear what we were saying. Our teller 's name at XXXX. I was instructed to wire the money to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX  XXXX. Beneficiary was to be XXXX XXXX, XXXX Account # XXXX Routing # XXXX Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, suite XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX was the beneficiary. I did this under great duress with my husband at my side. He instructed me to "" act normal '' because the teller may not be trusted. 
Once back in the car he asked for me to send a picture of the wire document and quickly told us to go back bank because the teller had put my name as it is stated on my XXXX accounts and made me the beneficiary. Returning to the bank the teller saw us and said he was about to call me because the wire did not go through with the way my name was stated. This time, because I was unable to do any further transactions due to stress, explained to the teller the corrections changing the name and beneficiary to what is mentioned above. The teller did not call a branch manager but proceeded to conduct the wire transfer. 

XX/XX/XXXX : The calls from XXXX continued on my husband 's phone while XXXX called me and again had me open Any Desk on my desktop computer, open my XXXX XXXX Account and with control of my computer began moving small amounts of that {$100000.00} into XXXX Reference # XXXX. He explained he had to do smaller amounts at a time so that the hackers could not trace it. 
He sold {$96000.00} Reference # XXXX and began the withdrawals using the XXXX XXXX app on my computer. He said, "" You can go do your work Mam, and I will do mine. '' I have email documentation of all withdrawals on XX/XX/XXXX as follow ; {$11000.00} ref : XXXX, {$11000.00} ref : XXXX, {$19000.00} ref : XXXX, {$19000.00} ref : XXXX, {$22000.00} ref : XXXX, {$9800.00} ref : XXXX, {$9800.00} ref : XXXX. {$4900.00} ref : XXXX For XXXX or XXXX of these I received emails stating the transactions were cancelled but XXXX XXXX would continue to try. XXXX told me to ignore these. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Final withdrawal {$13000.00} ref : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX apparently became ill and was "" in hospital '' so XXXX called me to open another account this time with XXXX while he continued to monitor our phones and send text messages. XXXX called me later to verify the account. He had me stay on the line while I called XXXX local to verify but it would not go through. The XXXX XXXX account was now at {$0.00} and they were trying to get the last of the retirement money through XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX texted me asking if I had gotten that verification email yet from XXXX. I had not. I had moved {$12000.00} out of my checking account to my XXXX Account with XXXX because I was concerned that it was all I had left. XXXX had me move it back to my checking account so I moved {$13000.00} and was waiting for verification to begin the securing these funds when the XXXX account was verified. 

XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX is continuing to be sick and XXXX is trying to follow up with me to get the last of the money stolen. All the while reassuring and even promising me that the money will be back in my account soon. I spoke to him by phone and said I was going to call the FBI and he said, "" Ma'am are your trying to scare me? Because we won't be scared. We are working for you to secure your funds and your IP Address. '' In text, "" ... just wait patiently, everything will be find and tomorrow you will have all your questions answered. '' My text : "" The XXXX XXXX account is XXXX balance, the crypto.com does not work. I have been looking into my XXXX XXXX help section to figure out if I did the wrong thing by calling the number on the email. '' XXXX 's reply : "" Your thinking to much ma'am! '' My text : "" Does XXXX XXXX  even send emails for orders? '' XXXX 's reply : "" I already told that there are certain steps has been taken by your bank ( XXXX XXXX ) to secure your funds! '' Don't think too much it might effect your health... forget everything, have a good sleep and tomorrow you once you get your answers then you would be happiest one. '' And, "" Whenever customer has any fraudulent charges every financial company ( aka XXXX XXXX ) sends emails. We never call our customers first. '' My text : "" How did XXXX XXXX know these charges were fraudulent? '' "" I want to call my XXXX XXXX '' XXXX 's reply : "" Because XXXX know you and your the owner of not your ( financial ) advisor. '' And, "" mark my words by tomorrow morning you will get your answers and everything will be fine. '' He tells me that XXXX will call me on a new secure line by XXXX est the next day. XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX because of inactivity on the old number a new one was created. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX calls from this number but within a few minutes the call disconnects and I am not able to all it back. Same with XXXX 's number. All contact has been cut by them. 

I then went to the bank to report the incident and we closed our checking account, followed direction to file a XXXX, XXXX police incidence report reference number XXXX. In the following days that week I also made a report to the FTC per my XXXX XXXX XXXX account. I also called XXXX XXXX to lock my account and made disputed reports for all transactions. A report to the FBI was also made and the above narrative was sent to that report. 

Again, this complaint is to have the XXXX acknowledge their role in our loss and hopefully be able to return the money to our account via XXXX.",None,STATE EMPLOYEES CREDIT UNION,NC,27407,Older American,Consent provided,Web,02/04/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8278972

The funds were available in my account at the time of payment. On XX/XX/XXXX the payment was declined. I was charged a late fee as well. I spoke to multiple reps and was hung up on while attempting to resolve this matter. The funds were still in the account for the payment being made so I asked if we can process the payment via debit since they were having problems processing it via ACH. I transferred the funds to my account that has a debit card linked to it and provided the rep with the card number. They stated they were having issues on their end with the payment. I asked if they would like to try another card. They stated they would try my card on file and read me the number. The number they read was not a card but an account number for my ACH payments. I stated no do not use that account because it will take days to process. The rep proceeded to process it anyway. I explained I wanted to make a debit payment so its processed today. They said they canceled the ACH and took another debit card that I moved the money to and this payment went through. They apologized for the inconvenience and stated they would submit a request for the fee waiver because of a processing error. This morning when I woke up I had an email stating the waiver was declined and I also saw they took two payments instead of one. One of these payments is unauthorized. They stated it would take 14 days to resolve. So they are charging me fees based on their error and taking unauthorized payments. I spoke to a supervisor who refused to help and hung up on me.

According to 15 USC 1681 ( d ) Consumer Report.

( 1 ) In general.The term consumer report means any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer 's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumers eligibility for ( A ) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes ; ( B ) employment purposes ; or ( C ) any other purpose authorized under section 1681b of this title.

( 2 ) Exclusions.Except as provided in paragraph ( 3 ), the term consumer report does not include ( A ) subject to section 1681s3 of this title, any ( i ) report containing information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report A charge off can only occur when late payments are reported. However, federal law clearly and conspicuously states that reports containing information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report is an exclusion. Do late payments not fall under experiences, which are not supposed to be part of the consumer report? These late payments were reported without authorization and in clear violation of federal law.

A payment may only be treated as late if certain requirements are abided by, one including those of 15 USC 1666 B, labeled under timing of payments. It is stated ; A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

Where is this documentation to validate these late payments that resulted in a charge off? This documentation pursuant of this statute, should have been provided to the credit reporting agencies as well as I, the consumer in order to furnish this information. 

I, the consumer, am stating I received no such documentation to validate the late payments being reported. 

If it is lucid that late payments are an exclusion, what is the basis of this charge-off? There is no justification for this unlawful action. I demand the immediate deletion of this account from my consumer report. 

If this account is not removed within 30 days of your receipt of this letter, I will have grounds to sue. Which will include, but its not limited to ; defamation of character negligent enablement of identity fraud Fair Credit Reporting Acts 15 USC 1681 violations for willful non-compliance and 616 civil liability for willful non-compliance I am fully aware of my consumer rights, and this charge-off was reported in complete disregard of those rights.

03/11/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with the interest rate,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I went to a car dealership with a pre-approval from Navy Federal. Importantly I purchased the car with the pre-approval in New Jersey, and I am a North Carolina resident. Having paid the title fee, I was told by both the dealership and Navy Federal confirmed that the transfer of the title would be transferred to Navy Federal as required. While Navy Federal changed the initial interest rate from the one shown after the initial purchase should be noted, but it's not the primary concern I'm reporting here. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed Navy Federal had increased the rate of the loan to 15.29 % without notifying me of the increase in my rate. When I called Navy Federal in XXXX to inquire, they revealed that they had increased the rate because they had not received the title. I asked again if that was something I was supposed to provide them, and they confirmed that was something they receive in the normal course from the dealership. During the XXXX - XXXX time period, Navy Federal had sent me over 40 emails, almost all of which were marketing emails, but not a single email about the increase in rate or the missing document. Further, in the secure messaging on their own website, there was no message about the predatory increase or the failure of Navy Federal and the dealership to appropriately transfer the title. During this time, I received no phone calls or text messages from Navy Federal. On the phone, they claimed they sent a notification via mail, but I have never received the alleged correspondence. Further, they could not confirm the address they'd provided the notices. They claimed it was for security reasons, but I had already answered all their security questions and been cleared. Even if the "" notification '' actually existed, it's obvious they were intentionally avoiding using a reliable communication channel ( email, secure mail, phone, or text messages ). They were not using the same communication tools they use to market their services or provide my typical account notices. On the phone, they told me I had to call the dealership, and there was nothing they could do. The loan would continue at the predatory rate. I called the dealership, XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX New Jersey, who confirmed they had appropriately handled the title in XX/XX/XXXX. At no point have I ever had possession of the title. 

Finally, I had the payments for the car payment set to autopay at the appropriate amount for the original rate. However, when they increased the rate without notifying me, one payment at the new predatory rate, was listed as not fully paid. I had to scramble to make up the {$300.00} in additional monthly interest to try to avoid this affecting my credit report. They have not confirmed that they will not report it as a missed payment on my credit report. 

Again, I tried to report this to Navy Federal, and they said they could not respond because I'd initiated this request through their mobile app. I notified them I would be contacting the CFPB as I could not resolve this with the bank directly. 

Please investigate the predatory auto lending practices and lack of appropriate notification at Navy Federal Credit Union.

04/25/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"Last XX/XX/2022 my bank account had financial fraud. When I first became aware of this and I didn't authorize any of the transactions, check that were written, the wire transfers I didn't approve of either. Along with these internet transfers had high fees attached to these transfers. When I first became aware of these unauthorized transactions I immediately called the customer care number and reported it. The guy that was helping me gave me a new account number but did not issue a new debit card which I asked him if I would be receiving one and he said no, which I thought was strange. However he reassured me that it was fine that I didn't need a new debit card. I trusted him. So I had a new account number at this time so I thought everything was fine, I was wrong the guy on the customer care line had linked the new account with my old account so the activity was still happening without me knowing. When I realized it once again what he had done I contacted customer care again and at this point I was issued a new account and bank card, and she made sure the accounts weren't linked together. This was not my fault even the lady from XXXX XXXX customer care team confirmed this. However, I took the steps on my part and filed a police report, and took all the steps to cover myself so that I would be compensated back. I filed my police report with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). The detective took my statement and I signed all paperwork to give him access to my accounts and any information needed while investigating my account. The detective arrested XXXX females almost XXXX weeks ago for the financial fraud on my account. When the detective called to let me know the arrests that were made. He also told me that he had reached out to the fraud department "" XXXX '' but could never get anyone to return his calls. While the investigation was taking place the fraud department had sent me a letter basically saying they would not continue this investigation and that I had basically lied about my account and the unauthorized transactions. They had decided that they would be closing my case and made it sound like they spoke with the detective. When in fact no one spoke with the detective. The employees that worked in the fraud department were never nice in dealing with them on the many occasions I spoke to them and it was several times that I was basically called a liar. So when the detective contacted me almost XXXX weeks ago and told me the news with the arrests and the investigation and how if he could be of any assistance in helping me recover the money that was took from me not to hesitate to call and he would help me in any way possible. He also told me that he never spoke with anyone. I asked him if it was true about what the credit fraud department had told me, and it was not. I have been a member of SECU for 8 plus years now and you want to think that when your account has this happen that your bank would stand behind their customers not this credit union. It's really sad for anyone to experience this but to have your bank not on your side, I'm lost for words. So when the detective told me the news of the arrests that had been made It was a sense of relief, so I immediately contacted my local branch and spoke with XXXX XXXX who had sat with me for over 3 hours in reviewing all the transactions that weren't mine, he even knew that it was fraud it was very obvious he even said himself. ( For example there would be a charge made by myself and XXXX minutes later another charge but it would be a good XXXX minutes away from where I was. There were several times that the transactions would be happening at the same time but at XXXX totally different places. ) XXXX told me I would have to contact customer care and he gave me the account numbers so it could be easily accessed. I called many times only to be put on hold and no one would answer when I was transferred and if they did answer it was only someone picking up the phone and hanging up on me. This happened I know for a fact XXXX  times. I called for XXXX weeks straight before finally speaking with someone and I was told XXXX was the XXXX on this case that I needed to speak with her but she was out of office for the next few days for me to leave a message and that he would also make note and make sure she returned my call back on Thursday XXXX well I never got a call, so I started calling the care line again everyday and it was the same as before I would be left on the line or someone would pick up and hang up on me. Then I spoke with a lady and she in fact her exact words were "" hold on XXXX while I ask some questions about this case '', XXXX would never take my call or speak with me on this matter she avoided me at all costs. That is very unprofessional in my opinion. I at least deserve to have my call taken, well when the employee came back she said "" they have closed your case and the fraud department also decided that they would not reopen your case, I asked why, I said well the arrests were made so I wasn't lying about any of this like they had said I was. The lady went on to say that it had taken to long, I understand it had been a long time but it's not like I could tell the detective you have to hurry up with your investigation. I did everything I was supposed to do to be compensated back the money that was rightfully mine. So now this is where I am and it really sucks to feel like this, it's one thing to be the victim and to experience financial fraud but to have the bank not backing you either I wouldn't wish this on anyone. This has been so stressful, humiliating, embarrassing along with the sleepless nights I have experienced. Not only did this affect me it affected my fiance and my kids. I would like to add that in their policy it states that they will stand behind their customers and that if police reports are filed, and you notify them immediately when you notice the activity. I did everything I was supposed to do. Also, it states that if they see transactions that they may suspect they will send a text about your account, I never received anything from SECU and you don't have to sign up to receive for this alert.",None,STATE EMPLOYEES CREDIT UNION,NC,28079,None,Consent provided,Web,04/25/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6880706
01/23/24,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue with the application process,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a HELOC Loan. My credit score at the time was XXXX. I have no student loans, was at or under XXXX XXXX for my credit card utilization. I also have never been late ( actually overpay ) on my mortgage since XX/XX/XXXX. I am also a XXXX XXXX  who resigned as a XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX. I also started to form my business ( have tax ID, and appropriate documentation from XX/XX/XXXX ). So the equity loan was to help with operation costs and other for my business. 

I did not receive any follow-up information about the status of my HELOC loan. Therefore, I called Sunday morning XX/XX/XXXX. The representative ( whos name I have via email with all supporting documents in reference to this matter ) told me that in order to be approved, my DTI had to be lower. I asked about adding my spouse. The representative asked my spouses racethen her tone changed and she mentioned we should be able to be approved. My spouses credit score was XXXX a with a delinquent payment history with other bills. Moreover, my spouse has close to {$200000.00} in student loan debt. 

Later that evening, I received a phone call stating my loan was approved. However, I would have to pay off my spouses debt ( car, credit cards, etc. ). Near the end of the discussion, I asked for the remaining amount for my HELOC loan. The representative mentioned I would have {$12000.00} remaining from my HELOC loan. If my spouses DTI was lower than mine, then why would I need a co-applicant? 

I followed up with NC State Employees Credit Union last week ( XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ) and I have yet to hear back in reference to the issue. I did try to go to two banks in person to file a formal complaint but was lead to believe I could not. They also sent a police officer in an XXXX  to the second bank of which I was the only person in the parking lot ( no other customers ). This lead me to feel uneasy so after I was told there was no manager in duty, I returned home. 

I also tried to contact them via email last week and there has been no clear response in reference to the matter. The CEOs name is listed ; I tried to email her ; however, from one email account it stated the email address could not be found. From the other : I was able to reach her ( XXXX XXXX ). There has still been no response in reference to the matter. Additionally, there have been {$500.00} of unauthorized transactions from my salary advance account which had up to {$1000.00} in it. At this point, this matter needs to be scrutinized thoroughly because I feel this bank has violated several banking codes. 

Lastly, I was listed on the application they filled out as not being affiliated with the military ( which I get monthly payments from and its drafted into my account with this banking agency ) and the amount is more than my spouses annual salary. Please thoroughly read the attachments. 

Again, I have ALL documentation and more, but ironically, I am receiving emails about moving forward with the {$100000.00} loan ( of which Ill get back XXXX  XXXX will not proceed ). I feel this bank is avoiding the issue and each day violating more and more laws/ethical codes of conduct. Thanks for investigating this matter. If anything else is needed, please feel free to reach me at XXXX.

After multiple phone calls over the course of the two weeks to follow I was condescended and belittled by 3 supervisors who claimed it was my fault that the title had gone missing and one who stated that NFCU records showed them never receiving the title from XXXX. 
Once the records of both the CA DMV and NFCU XXXX and a branch in XXXX XXXX Florida were checked the following was concluded : In XXXX of XXXX, I made a request, through the branch in XXXX XXXX Fl, to have the title sent there so I could register the vehicle as I had just been stationed in FL. A request was made to CADMV to turn the XXXX into a paper copy ( per CADMV records ) That paper copy was mailed to NFCU with a tracking number to confirm receipt on XXXX at the address on file ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, PA ) ( per CADMV records ). From there it was sent via XXXX standard mail to the branch in XXXX XXXX FL. ( per NFCU records ). The branch confirmed that it has no records of ever receiving it or reaching out to me to inform me that it never came in. NFCU has an internal policy that if a title is sent to a branch and not claimed by the member that it is to be returned to the main title holding section in PA after 30 days ( per NFCU ). That policy was never carried out. ( per NFCU ) The events as outlined above and the negligence demonstrated by NFCU to follow common sense practice, such as utilizing mail with tracking service, and disregard for internal policy resulted in the title for my vehicle going missing and remaining missing for a period of 2 years and ultimately resulted in the inability of myself to sell the vehicle to an individual who had arranged to pay more than the remaining loan amount.

In order to try and correct this matter NFCU filed for a duplicate title from CADMV ( per NFCU record ) and charged me a {$25.00} fee ( which they said would be waived prior to me giving consent for the order ). It was only after I received a letter stating that the amount had been debited from my account and confirming via the online app, and calling the help line that the amount was refunded to me. 
I tried negotiating for fair resolution on three separate occasions through a case manager as NFCU supervisors said case managers are the only ones who can do anything beyond. All three were denied. 
No further resolution has been reached. 

For these reasons and pursuant to 12 USC 5531 I am filing the complaint of abuse. Navy Federal Credit Union took unreasonable advantage of my reliance on them to safeguard the property held and displayed negligence on multiple occasions to follow set policy, which is not consistent with acting in the best interest of the consumer.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,NC,28734,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,08/22/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7437672

Where is my 1099-C, NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION AND XXXX XXXX is clearly writing off debt with the IRS without sending out 1099-C as required by the IRS for debts greater than { { { {$600.00} } } }.

A negotiable instrument is a signed document that promises a payment to a specified person or assignee. Negotiable instruments are transferable, which allows the recipient to take the funds as cash, then use them as preferred. Examples of negotiable instruments include checks, money orders, and promissory notes. 

With that being said, the promissory note is of the same value of whats owed. They have either already received the cash from the promissory note which then would have satisfied the loan or if not Im requesting that they do so by accepting it for value and transfer back to Navy Federal to cash and fulfill the obligation of the loan. 

UCC 3-603 TENDER OF PAYMENT ( a ) If tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument, the effect of tender is governed by principles of law applicable to tender of payment under a simple contract. 

( b ) If tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument and the tender is refused, there is discharge, to the extent of the amount of the tender, of the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse with respect to the obligation to which the tender relates. 

( c ) If tender of payment of an amount due on an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument, the obligation of the obligor to pay interest after the due date on the amount tendered is discharged. If presentment is required with respect to an instrument and the obligor is able and ready to pay on the due date at every place of payment stated in the instrument, the obligor is deemed to have made tender of payment on the due date to the person entitled to enforce the instrument. 

UCC 3-104 ( b ) "" Instrument '' means a negotiable instrument. 

( e ) An instrument is a "" note '' if it is a promise and is a "" draft '' if it is an order. If an instrument falls within the definition of both "" note '' and "" draft, '' a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either. 

UCC 3-108 ( a ) A promise or order is "" payable on demand '' if it ( i ) states that it is payable on demand or at sight, or otherwise indicates that it is payable at the will of the holder, or ( ii ) does not state any time of payment. 

( b ) A promise or order is "" payable at a definite time '' if it is payable on elapse of a definite period of time after sight or acceptance or at a fixed date or dates or at a time or times readily ascertainable at the time the promise or order is issued, subject to rights of ( i ) prepayment, ( ii ) acceleration, ( iii ) extension at the option of the holder, or ( iv ) extension to a further definite time at the option of the maker or acceptor or automatically upon or after a specified act or event. 
( c ) If an instrument, payable at a fixed date, is also payable upon demand made before the fixed date, the instrument is payable on demand until the fixed date and, if demand for payment is not made before that date, becomes payable at a definite time on the fixed date.

These violations pertain to the unauthorized disclosure of my nonpublic personal information to non-affiliated third parties without proper notice or consent, a clear breach of privacy regulations outlined in the aforementioned laws.

Congressional Findings and Compliance Obligations : 15 U.S. Code 1681 emphasizes the critical importance of fair and accurate credit reporting for the efficiency of the banking system. It mandates fair evaluation of consumer information by reporting agencies and stresses the significance of consumer privacy protection.

Consumer reporting agencies are legally obligated under 15 U.S. Code 1681e to implement procedures ensuring the highest accuracy of consumer reports. Continental Finance Company/Celtic Bank 's disclosure of inaccurate information violates these obligations and breaches statutory provisions.

Details of Violations : 1. **Disclosure of Nonpublic Personal Information : ** Continental Finance Company/Celtic Bank without obtaining requisite consent or providing proper notice, disclosed my personal information to non-affiliated third parties namely XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX This action directly violates the Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S. Code 552a ) and the FCRA ( 15 U.S. Code 6802 ).

2. **Failure to Provide Opt-Out Opportunity : ** I was not offered the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of my nonpublic personal information, as mandated by the FCRA 15 U.S. Code 6802 ( b ), exacerbating the violation.

3. **Continued Right to Opt Out : ** As per 16 CFR 313.7 ( f ), I reserve the right to opt out at any time, a privilege denied to me by Continental Finance Company/Celtic Banks actions .

4. **Exclusion of Transaction and Experience Information : ** Continental Finance Company/Celtic Bank included transaction history within reported information, violating the exclusionary provision of 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ).

The unauthorized disclosure of my personal information by Continental Finance Company/Celtic Bank has caused significant financial and emotional distress, disrupting my life.

Remedial Actions Demanded : 1. **Immediate Deletion of Reports : ** I demand the immediate deletion of any reports or disclosures made by Continental Finance Company/Celtic Bank that contain my personal information, specifically transaction history.

2. **Compensation for Damages : ** Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681n, I demand compensation of {$1000.00} per violation for the damages incurred due to Continental Finance Company/Celtic Bank 's willful noncompliance.

I request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to take swift action against Continental Finance Company/Celtic Bank to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations outlined above. Your intervention is crucial to rectify this situation promptly and hold the institution accountable for their unlawful actions.

Enclosed are supporting documents detailing the violations and their impact on my financial and emotional well-being. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and await your prompt action.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Continental Finance Company, LLC",NC,27265,None,Consent provided,Web,12/24/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8054093

This account is being reported by XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 
In addition to my dispute reasonings, this is a notification of I, the consumer ordering a cease and desist. Meaning after receipt of this letter, By law Celtic Bank has no right to contact me via any form of communication. This includes through phone, email, and my consumer report. Failure to abide will result in legal action being taken. 
The payment history for this account is completely inaccurate amongst all agencies. XXXX has no payment history for this account. XXXX is showing a first delinquency date of XX/XX/XXXX with no payment history to show forth, and a report date of XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX and XXXX show a report date of XX/XX/XXXX. 
With this account being only updated as of XX/XX/XXXX, instead of updated and verified, I can only assume that the proper action was not taken to investigate the validity of this account. All the account information remains the same even after numerous disputes of the same inaccurate information. 
In addition, the amount for this account is XXXX dollars. Meaning, nothing is owed to this creditor. This information should not be furnished on my report if there is no monetary obligation. This account is also listed as paid on XXXX. The date of last activity is not listed on XXXX. As a consumer, I have the right to receive complete information. By allowing this incomplete information on my report I am unable to determine several things. XXXX of which includes, when the statute of limitations runs out. 
This furnisher failed to comply with their obligation of supplying I, the consumer with a complete and accurate credit report. This account also does not reflect my disputes from XXXX nor from XXXX in the comments section of any agency. 
This is well over XXXX inaccuracies that Ive listed. This furnisher had numerous chances to rectify the situation when disputes were sent out and failed to do so. Instead of handling the situation appropriately, they instead knowingly furnished inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent information on my report. 
Delete this account for being in violation of the FCRA. 

( a ) Duty of Furnishers of Information to Provide Accurate Information ( XXXX ) Prohibition ( A ) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors. A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. 
( B ) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors. A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. 


The following is the obligation listed by the CFPB pertaining to companies ' responsibility to remove unverified information. 
The FCRA provides people multiple ways to dispute inaccurate information on their credit reports. Commonly, people dispute the accuracy of information on their credit reports with a credit reporting company, such as XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX. In response, the credit reporting company often refers the dispute to the company that provided the disputed information. When a person submits a dispute to a credit reporting company, and it is passed along to the company that originally provided the disputed information, the company is then required to conduct its own investigation into the disputed information. 
If a company that provided disputed information to a credit reporting agency is unable to determine whether the information is true or not, the law requires them to tell the credit reporting company the information could not be verified so that the credit reporting company will stop reporting it. Nonetheless, some companies have argued that if they are unable to determine that the disputed information is false, they are free to tell the consumer reporting company to continue providing the information on reports. 
Thats wrong, as the CFPB and FTCs brief explains. In the FCRA, XXXX put express requirements on companies with respect to information that can not be verified. Those requirements would be meaningless if companies could continue providing unverified information and telling credit reporting companies that they could continue sharing it. 
If this account is not deleted I will have means to assume this is an act of willful noncompliance which is punishable by the following : Any person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( XXXX ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure; and ( XXXX ) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Continental Finance Company, LLC",NC,28083,None,Consent provided,Web,05/15/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,9002050

I began the process of assuming a mortgage in XXXX XXXX  and finally closed at the end of XX/XX/2023. Throughout this process I experienced numerous issues, all documented in emails and phone calls that went unresolved. I requested a new loan officer be assigned to my case on two occasions and submitted multiple complaints with no resolution. The closing disclosure was wrought with issues that pointed out and sought resolution for, but communication was incredibly difficult. The values of escrow, the insurance policies, and the final mortgage were inaccurate and I requested explanation numerous times and received no responses. On the day of closing, the disclosure still did not accurately reflect the appropriate values and the proposed monthly payment for the property was not accurate. I have continuously attempted to communicate with XXXX XXXX to seek resolution, but I have received no responses. The mortgage assumptions department has completely ceased all communication with me and has refused to respond to calls and emails. I was told in subsequent phone calls to account services that an escrow analysis would be done to resolve the issue, but I have received no communication on this matter. My insurance premium changed from the previous home owner 's and my account has not reflected this change, requiring me to continue to pay the previous mortgage payment for two months now. I use a different insurance company and my premium is significantly lower which means my total mortgage payment should be less. These changes have not been reflected and a service member recently told me that Navy Federal reported my premium as more than triple what it actually is ( I of course have access to my own insurance account ). What's more is that I have never received copies of the signed documents and I am unable to access my mortgage account through the online portal. I was also issued a letter informing me that I would be charged for a lapse in insurance coverage that occurred before I became the home owner. When I called about this matter I was instructed to send a digital message with pictures of the letter and my insurance policy as attachments. NO response has been given about this issue leading me to continue to call for resolution with no assistance. I honestly do not know what to do at this point. I have tried to communicate and have asked for simple, specific questions about the mortgage to the assumptions department that have been neglected. This has made the entire process feel shady and utterly disappointing. I am concerned that I am being bound to payments that do no accurately reflect true values associated with my mortgage. I have completely lost track of the number of phone calls and emails I have sent throughout this process and attempts to resolve these matters.
