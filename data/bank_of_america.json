I sent a letter to Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX. asking them to restore my credit limit or provide additional information explaining the decision. Because of the potential for this change to have a substantially negative impact on my access to credit I am not willing to wait for Bank of America to respond. \n\nI received a letter dated XX/XX/year>, that lists three reasons that Bank of America elected to decrease my credit limit : Current or past delinquency on one or more of your accounts with us and/or our affiliates Recent trend in balance on one or more of your accounts, with us and our affiliates, compared to past balance Strength of payment on one or more of your accounts with us and/or our affiliates. \n\nAs the letter advised, I immediately reviewed my credit report from XXXX XXXX. Based on the report as of XX/XX/year>, no evidence supports any reasons for reducing my credit limit. There is no indication of any late payments on the credit report, no irregular or rapid increase or decrease in my balance owed, and my payments have been consistent and automatic for many years. When my promotional rate on a portion of my balance recently expired, I ensured that my automated payments increased to cover the new minimums. \n\nThe only recent change that occurred in my relationship with Bank of America or their affiliates was the expiration of my promotional balance transfer rate on a portion of my balance. The expiry is likely the real reason my credit limit decreased. There is no evidence on my credit report supporting the reasons given. As mentioned above, I needed to adjust my payments, and I did so before the XX/XX/XXXX due date, which was more than XXXX days after the date of the XX/XX/XXXX letter informing me of the decision to lower my credit limit. \n\nBecause the decision to lower my credit limit will harm my ability to obtain credit and be used as a basis to either increase my interest rate or further decrease my credit limit. The justifications listed in the XX/XX/XXXX letter do not stand up to even the most cursory inspection of my credit report from XXXX XXXX or any of the other XXXX credit reporting agencies. \n\nThis decision to reduce my credit limit is arbitrary and an attempt to manipulate my financial reputation.

The card was good to go. I use the card. XXXX got approved that same day. I used it again the same thing happened. I had to call, they wanted to verify my identity again I did that transaction Got approved so the next day, which was XX/XX/XXXX I used it again. Everything was good then I used it on XX/XX/XXXX for a cash advance. I took XXXX out the ATM I want it XXXX but the ATM only did XXXX at a time so I did another XXXX it got declined. So then I had called and they told me I needed documents to unrestricted my account so I faxed over documents around XX/XX/XXXX. I called on the XXXX. They said my documents were blurry But my utility bill or bank statement was approved and readable and they told me all I needed to do was resend my Social Security card and my drivers license then I submitted more documents. They receive them on XX/XX/XXXX I called a couple days later they said they were still on the review and I asked, a account specialist if they could verify that my documents were clear and they said yes they are readable so you should be good to go, but we are not the department that verifies them. The next couple days I was calling I was getting hung up on Representatives were telling me different things that I was notified that my account was at the highest level of security and they couldnt tell me why they told me it takes 7 to 10 business days to approve my documents or review them But I decided to send documents by mail also just to be on the safe side so they couldnt say that it was blurry again so then Around XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX I was told that my documents were approved Buy two different departments, but the highest level of security department a representative name XXXX  believe said I needed a Utility bill or bank statement because I only sent my ID or drivers license and my Social Security card. But XXXX said that my ID and Social Security card were approved I informed the lady that the utility bill document have already gotten approved at the end of XXXX. Also XXXX  informed me that no theres a note here that says you sent a credit card statement as the proof of address I said maam, that is my first time hearing this, I said, can you double check the notes and look further and she said OK so she put me on hold for about five minutes then she comes back and she says she found the bank statement that I sent that had gotten approved already so Im getting excited thinking that theyre about to remove the restriction so then Im going to resubmit all your documents back for a second review call back Monday. See if everything got approved already. She really had no explanation so I said you know what I just called back Monday So I decided to call back later that day to see if someone else give me a different answer so I called back a lady name A lady named XXXX answered the phone and she basically says your documents are still under review. They never been approved. I said maam I called earlier they told me that they were approved. She said so why didnt they remove the restriction? I said maam I do not know thats what XXXX trying to find out, she she hung the phone up on me and she was rude. Also, this isnt the first time that XXXX hung the phone up on me. I also filed a complain about her. So I called back a third time to get another answer the same day another representative said basically your documents had been submitted for a second review so now this is going on 30 days I submitted documents and I keep getting the same answer refusing to remove my restriction off my card, I havent use my card since XX/XX/XXXX. Mind you my my account was already good to go around XX/XX/XXXX or the XXXX because different departments told me everything looked good. I just need it for a certain department to remove the restriction so I requested for this to get escalated because this is really out of hand and unprofessional for all the lies that they keep telling me about my account I dont know what it is, but I did everything they asked me to do, so I have this credit card on my credit report that I cant even use and they block me for access to my online account so I cant see anything thats going on so something needs to happen because I cant even get in touch with a manager because they dont take inbound calls I requested for several callbacks. They did call me back once or twice left voicemail, but I was unavailable to answer at the time I dont know whats going on with this detention department or security department that they have but theyre doing whatever they want to do and its not fair and every time a representative read the notes on my account. They treat me differently because of what they read I dont know what they put in my notes, but it has to be something unprofessional and for them to treat me a different type of way when I call because every time they read the notes, they hang the phone up on me or they tell me that my documents are still under review 10 business days is it the 30th business day and theyre still under review", "date_sent_to_company": "2024-10-22T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Trouble using your card", "sub_product": "General-purpose credit card or charge card", "zip_code": "28303", "tags": "Older American", "complaint_id": "10521617", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE", "date_received": "2024-10-22T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": "Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response", "sub_issue": "Can't use card to make purchases"}, "sort": [24169]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "10484488", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Credit card", "complaint_what_happened": "Barclays customer service has continously for over 2 years refused to by provide me XXXX staments after stating to me that they will have a XXXX XXXX  contact me and make accomodations.

He said that USAA is affiliated with XXXX Bank, and that the bank will let me open a new joint account through them. He gave me a virtual debit card over the phone to enter in my XXXX wallet. I was afraid that if I did not comply I would loose access to my account with my bank, or that the bank would shut down my account. \n\nWhile the man was on the phone with me, he told me to do a cash advance of {$10000.00} ( though I only had {$6500.00} in my savings ) and that he would initiate this amount from my all my accounts, to my checking. I went to the teller at XXXX bank and entered my Debit card to their card reader. Then he told me to enter that {$10000.00} cash through the XXXX bank ATM using the XXXX card on the mobile wallet.

Furthermore, the phone numbers listed as verification are unfamiliar to me, and I have no record of ownership or usage of these numbers. In light of the discrepancies mentioned above, I also wish to address the statute of limitations for debt collection in North Carolina. As per North Carolina credit laws, the statute of limitations for most types of debt is three years. It is crucial to determine whether the statute of limitations has expired in this case, as it may affect the creditor 's ability to pursue legal action to enforce the debt. I request that you thoroughly review the relevant dates and account history to assess compliance with the statute of limitations. In accordance with the FCRA and North Carolina credit laws, I kindly request that you initiate a comprehensive investigation into the validity and accuracy of the information provided by Discover. This investigation should include verification of the aforementioned addresses, phone numbers, and any other associated details. I also request that you obtain and review any supporting documentation provided by Discover, such as written documents or records, to substantiate their claims.

The mobile app did not display any balance and, as a result, did not allow me to pay it. I accessed the mobile app multiple times in XXXX and XXXX attempting to find the balance that corresponded with my e-Statements. I was confused and assumed the e-Statements I received were a glitch or error. \n\nPrior to XXXX, at the end of XXXX, my phone and other cards were stolen while I was traveling in XXXX. After the theft, I called FNBO to ask if I could use the card while traveling. Instead of answering my question or helping, they froze my account on suspicion of fraud. The only way they would un-freeze the card would be if I did a bank ID, which I told them was impossible, given I was out of the country and would not return to the US until the middle of XXXX. I believe the freezing of the account could have had an impact on the failure of the app to accurately represent my balance. I also believe the timing of the freezing led to my confusion about the e-Statements being erroneous. \n\nFNBO 's records show that they sent me one email reminder to pay my credit card balance at the end of XXXX ( XXXX : an email reminder is not a notice of delinquency ) and letters in the mail after I missed the XX/XX/XXXX pay deadline. If FNBO had taken note and/or communicated to their collections department that I was out of the country they could have sent communications other then letters to my home address in North Carolina to notify me of my ongoing delinquency and need to pay. Given the error in the mobile app, I was under the impression that I had no balance to pay until my account was closed last week ( XX/XX/XXXX ). \n\nThe effect of closing my account has had a disastrous impact on my credit score and has even caused my other lines of credit to decrease my credit limit with them. I had a perfect payment history with FNBO ( and all my other cards ) before this communication failure. Additionally, I paid significantly much more on my other credit cards during the period that FNBO reported me as delinquent.

It took XXXX years to settle and has resulted in an incorrect XXXX issued creating a large tax liability for us. The original mortgage was through Countrywide and bought by Bank of America. In XXXX, the mortgage was refinanced utilizing the XXXX act resulting in an agreed upon monthly payment which was religiously made each month. However, over the next 9 years, BAC lost the paperwork a total of XXXX times necessitating resubmissions from us to formally document the agreement. During that time the reduced payments were considered partial payments and resulting in BAC initiated foreclose proceedings in XXXX. During this time entire time payments were ( and several lost by BAC even though cancelled checks were submitted ), lost paperwork updated and sent, numerous attorneys hired on both sides, legal briefings, discussions and arbitrations held all at BACs request. After XXXX years and through multiple attorneys, a final agreement was reached and signed on XX/XX/XXXX. HOWEVER, it wasnt over! \n\nUnfortunately, BAC issued an incorrect XXXX XXXX. Per the final agreement, a settlement amount was given to us to cover attorney fees and costs incurred by us. This is designated in the agreement on page XXXX of XXXX ; paragraph XXXX : \" Full Satisfaction. The XXXX is in full satisfaction of the Released Matters ( as defined herein ), and it includes all attorneys fees and costs that Defendants XXXX have incurred in connection with the XXXX. ' Per the IRS and the XXXX, this is a non-taxable event. However, BAC has issued a XXXX XXXX stating XXXX amount as taxable. From XXXX to XXXX, multiple attempts have been made to correct the problem. The attorneys settling the case advised us to work with BAC directly to solve the issue. The attempts were fruitless, again, lost documents, multiple XXXX with no direct communication to the group responsible for the issuing of the XXXX. The XXXX itself has an XXXX number that doesnt work. Detailed below are the latest attempts as there are too many to detail from XXXX to XXXX. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX IRS agent assigned and XXXX XXXX date assigned. Agreement with IRS that BAC should issue a corrected XXXX XXXX with 3 of the XXXX stating a XXXX XXXX. All documents must be turned into the XXXX XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX. The IRS agent also stated that if a corrected XXXX can not physical be issued quickly, a letter on Bank of America letterhead stating that a corrected XXXX with Box 3 as XXXX  is in process would be acceptable until the corrected XXXX is in process XXXX \n\nXX/XX/XXXX Multiple phone discussions with BAC over 2 hours via 3 different XXXX. The operators could not find the agreement nor the XXXX XXXX in question and had NO facility to have us send them to them. After many phone transfers and much discussion and verification, the operator opened case # XXXX. All details as stated above were noted in the case and it was expedited. Since the operator had no facility to accept the agreement or XXXX in question, we went to a BAC branch and faxed the incorrect XXXX, a full copy of the XXXX XXXX, the IRS information and contact and a cover explaining the entire situation. A fax confirmation was received. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX No updates on this case XXXX had been received. Spent 3 hours on 4 different XXXX # XXXX and 4 different operators. First, the case couldnt be found. Then, both names werent on the loan which was eventually found after much discussion. The status given to us was that the case was rejected due to the original operator submitting an incorrect code and/or form. We were not notified of this in any way. This current operator created a new case # XXXX and stated that it was expedited and full details ( as previously stated ) were added to the case. We were told that we should call back to XXXX in 7 days to get status. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX Received letter from BAC dated XX/XX/XXXX stating We cant add ( husbands full name ) and ( wifes full name ) as authorized third party of your home loan. We are ALREADY the stated lenders on the loan. This is further proof of BAC 's incompetence in this entire matter. \n\nThe XXXX XXXX date is XX/XX/XXXX and all documentation must be sent to them by XX/XX/XXXX. Based on BAC displayed incompetence and lack of responsiveness in this matter, it is unlikely that we receive a corrected XXXX from them to meet the XXXX date. Therefore, we respectfully submit this complaint as a request for additional help. \n\n\nCC : Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX, CEO BAC ( XXXX ) IRS, Examination Appeals, New York", "date_sent_to_company": "2023-07-21T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Closing on a mortgage", "sub_product": "Conventional home mortgage", "zip_code": "27127", "tags": "Older American", "complaint_id": "7286373", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION", "date_received": "2023-07-21T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": "Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response", "sub_issue": null}, "sort": [128578]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "10223205", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports", "complaint_what_happened": "This debt collector engaged in abusive, deceptive, and unfair practices of the FDCPA which it prohibits.

XXXX confirmed that the hold was removed from the funds, and he closed the account. He transferred the money back to the original XXXX XXXX account that the money originally came from via ACH transfer. XXXX told me that the money should be back in my XXXX XXXX account by XX/XX/XXXX at the latest. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, the money had not been credited to my XXXX XXXX account, nor did my Marcus account show that a debit, or account closure was in process. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke to a representative named XXXX. She stated that the money in my account was placed on another hold, and would not be released until XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, I asked to speak to a supervisor. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I next spoke to a supervisor named XXXX who confirmed that the money in the account was on hold, and that closing the account would take an additional 10 business days PLUS an additional 3 business days for the ACH transfer to be completed, which would be an additional 2.50 weeks total. I asked why there were so many holds being placed on the money, and why it was taking so long for the money to be transferred back to the account where it originated from, and XXXX said that this is just reflective of Marcuss policies and processes. \n\nI am filing this complaint because I believe that Marcus is engaging in a pattern of deception, inefficiency, and deliberately slow processing times in order to retain their customers monies as long as possible, and I believe this pattern needs oversight and intervention by the US Government.

My last communications with Discover Card was in XXXX. Since XXXX I had no contact with Discover Card. No calls or correspondence. In XXXX I was diagnosed with an XXXX XXXX XXXX that impacted my health and employment and life style. My entire world was shattered, however, I am thankful to be alive. XXXX XXXX XXXX are not curable and my life is like a roller coaster day to day. I lost work hours and wages, accumulated medical expenses and was trying to maintain a roof over my head and food on the table. I contacted Discover Card and set up a payment arrangement, but it began a struggle to keep up due to the lack of funds. The stress of this hardship took a toll on my finances and health. My intention was to some how start making payments again, but then the XXXX  ( XXXX ) came about and having a compromised health condition I was not able to work and received even less income then when I originally became ill in XXXX. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, a XXXX XXXX was at my door with a ( Judgement ) Motion to Claim Exempt Property notice. I was frighted because I was never notified prior to receiving that a XXXX was being filed against me. I was scheduled for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX with a XXXX week XXXX XXXX  and 10 days to file the papers and I didn't want to get stressed out and get XXXX  about this because I had so many questions about this, so I thought it was best to follow the instructions on the document fill it out the best as I could and just submit the papers and ask the clerk questions. I immediately submitted the judgment response to the court on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked the court clerk what were the next steps and they said I would hear back from Discover card within 3 months or so. I waited to hear from Discover to share my concerns and ask questions, but I never received a call or letter from them regarding the Judgment. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I returned home from an appointment to find a calling card on my door from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX XXXX. I called the number of the calling card that day XXXX because I was panic stricken because I never heard back from Discover Card. On XX/XX/XXXX I left another message for XXXX XXXX. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX I left another message from the XXXX to please return my call me that morning because I had appointments and didn't want to miss his call. The deputy returned my call that morning and explained that Discover Card has filed an Execution order against me and he informed me the original balance was {$7400.00}, but with past due and other fees the asking balance is {$9700.00}. He asked what I could put towards the balance, I informed him that I have no money, or property as a result I live in affordable income based housing for seniors. I asked the duty how could Discover file an execution and judgment without contacting me. He stated they mailed me a letter on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I asked who signed for the letters because I didn't and I live alone and I have not received any kind of contact or communication about this matter and I receive all of my mail without any problems. The deputy said that Discover mailed letter to me at my current address. \n\nFIRST, I explained that I did not reside at this address in XXXX and again I have not heard or received any communications about my Discover account since XXXX. Due to my change in income and medical conditions, I had to move into affordable housing and income based apartments for senior cititzens otherwise, I would have been home-less because my income had decreased, therefore, I had to make multiply life style changes due to my health and finances ( I can prove all of this ). The judgment notice that I received in XXXX XXXX was the first time I heard anything about my Discover card since XXXX. I stated to the deputy that Discover is treating me unfairly by escalating and harassing me with legal matters that I didn't know about. Even after returning the documents to the court in XXXX, I still never heard back from Discover as the clerk said I would or anything about it until The deputy left a calling card on my door on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX stated he would contact Discover and get back to me and I have not heard from him yet. So I have not received the execution yet. I really don't know what's on it. \n\nI am a responsible person not a dead beat person. I never thought I would be in a situation like this. Unfortunate circumstances occurred in my life beyond my control and it became a hardship to make ends meet. I am not a deadbeat person. I tried to maintain my finances to the best of my ability until I could no longer do it. Discover has the right to request payment for debits, but they should do it in a legally right way.

Surprisingly, Some of cards mailed to my business addresses, and some of them were mailed to my home in the state of XXXX. However, I never received those cards before.

Representatives said that they sent out a mail explaining everything, but the result letter did not explain anything. I just saw a letter saying their investigation concluded as \" they are all correct information. '' BUT HOW DO THEY EXPECT ME TO AGREE WITH INVESTIGATION RESULT WITHOUT ANY PROOF? I don't even know how identity thief obtained my information, what kind of information was submitted. I can't understand or agree with their process of investigation.

My daughter and son are the borrowers, and my husband and I are the cosigners. We're committed to fulfilling our financial obligations, but Discover has made this unattainable. We have lodged two complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, reached out to relevant District Attorney 's offices, and directly contacted Discover 's leadership. Throughout this period, we've personally encountered tactics from Discover Student Loans that we view as infringing on our rights and indicative of predatory lending practices. Around two years ago, we had no choice but to default on these unmanageable loans. This decision was not made lightly, as we knew it would further damage our already compromised credit scores and hinder our ability to accumulate assets. Despite our plight, Discover showed no willingness to negotiate or take steps to ameliorate the situation. \n\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, Discover filed civil suits against us, initiating another phase in our contentious financial struggle. We enlisted the help of a student loan attorney because XXXX XXXX XXXX, acting on behalf of Discover, refused to negotiate with us and demanded the full balance either upfront or in five-year installments. Our attorney managed to secure a reduced repayment rate of {$2400.00} per month for the next five years for both loans. Discover stipulated that missing even one payment would nullify the settlement agreement. Additionally, since Discover will consider the loans unsettled until the last cent is paid, both the students ' and cosigners ' credit scores will be negatively impacted until the final payment is made in five years, effectively holding our credit hostage over that duration of time. This severely limits our ability to make any credit-based transactions like buying a car or home, or even renting, while Discover continues to collect {$2400.00} monthly from us for the next five years. \n\nTo complicate matters, the timeline for finalizing this settlement was unnecessarily tight. When the proposal was finally on the table on XX/XX/XXXX, we were informed that the first payment had to be wired before the month 's end ; otherwise, the deal would be off. Despite this tight deadline, there were multiple inaccuracies in the details they provided, such as wrong account numbers and addresses, misrepresentation to the District Court, inaccurate paperwork, etc., which we had to scramble to correct. Inaccuracies on DiscoverXXXX  part included : After making the initial mandated payment before the tight deadline, we discovered Discover/XXXX had omitted an entire account from the agreement. This missing information was sent later via regular mail, contrary to the expedited faxing they used for the rest of the account details. The omitted account was subsequently included in the settlement, which raised the agreed-upon amount by nearly {$4000.00} and increased our monthly payments by {$64.00}. Despite this oversight on their part, there were no apologies or accommodations made, although they held us strictly accountable to the original agreement payment deadline. \nWe continuously received notifications from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in North Carolina regarding our selection for random arbitration. We reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, notifying her of our ongoing settlement agreements, which essentially serve the purpose of arbitration. This correspondence also included our attorney and XXXX attorneys. However, XXXX XXXX stated she needed verification from the plaintiff 's attorneys. Despite having communicated our settlement agreement, we were still provided with an arbitration date. Consequently, our attorney requested XXXX to update the courts. Yet, we were surprised when we received another notification of impending arbitration for a second case. I promptly communicated with XXXX XXXX, referencing all XXXX case files that had been settled. She acknowledged being aware of the settlement for the first case during the arbitration hearing that occurred on XXXX XXXX. It's perplexing that the court proceeded with arbitration for an already settled case. It's worth noting that we hadn't even provided the necessary documents, which were due two weeks prior to the arbitration date. Surprisingly, no one followed up on these missing documents. It raises questions about whether this arbitration was merely a procedural formality to ensure certain individuals received compensation. It seems like a misuse of taxpayers ' funds and a dubious system where individuals might be compensated without rendering actual services. Will this same situation arise for the other three Discover cases that we've already settled? \nOn XX/XX/XXXX, our lawyer updated me about a conversation he had with XXXX the day before. They apparently did not receive our daughters payment made in XXXX. It's noteworthy that this is the same account for which they had given the wrong account number and still proceeded with an arbitration hearing. When we got the written agreement through mail for notarization back in XXXX, our attorney had immediately informed XXXX about the error in our daughters account number. At that time, they assured him they would ensure the funds were directed to the right account. However, they now claim not to have received the payment. It's important to note that both childrens payments for XXXX were sent together, via BoA wire, as a single transaction to expedite the process and avoid any penalties. The total amount included the due amounts for both accounts, clearly specifying both account numbers. From XXXX onward, we've made individual payments for each account. On XX/XX/XXXX, our lawyer found himself reiterating the same information to XXXX that he had shared back in XXXX. \nDuring the conversation our lawyer had with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX mentioned that while they had received the notarized settlement copies for the children, they hadn't received them for the cosigners. However, the documents provided to us were specifically set up for notarization for our children only, not for the cosigners ( an example of this is available for reference ). A XXXX XXXX will only notarize a document for the individuals explicitly named on that document. XXXX suggested we use the same documents they initially sent. I advised our attorney to ask XXXX to provide us with the appropriate documents so that both my husband and I can duly get them notarized. \n\nThese errors occurred as DiscoverXXXX maintained their demand for a turnaround of less than one week for the first payment. The entire process has been marked by errors and omissions, but also penalties, consistent with our past decade-long experience with Discover. Nonetheless, they continue to wield disproportionate power over our lives, unapologetically impairing our financial well-being and hindering our progress. Holding our credit profile XXXX for 5 years while they received {$2400.00} per month should be illegal. \n\nI know that Discover Bank has received attention from the CFPB ( Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ). I know that politicians such as XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX are also spearheading legislation to stop predatory student loan lenders. XXXX XXXX created a bill called The CFPB Student Loan Integrity & Transparency Act of XXXX, which \" would strengthen the oversight abilities of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's ( CFPB ) student loan ombudsman, the top federal official responsible for defending the interests of student borrowers struggling to repay their loans. '' \" This officials oversight capabilities were undermined when CFPB Acting XXXX XXXX XXXX closed the only federal office solely dedicated to protecting student loan borrowers : the Office of Students and Younger Consumers. '' I know the CFPB also filed a lawsuit against a company with the names \" College Financial Advisory '' and \" Student Financial Resource Center '' for \" conducting a nationwide operation that deceived students and their families into paying a fee in exchange for an illusory student financial aid program. '' Data shows that Student debt negatively impacts the economy and continues to Reinforce the XXXX wealth gap. '' Regardless of the incomes they make after graduation, XXXX households carry more student debt, which pushes down their creditworthiness. Unsurprisingly, then, XXXX people with a college degree have lower homeownership rates than white high school dropouts. '' \" There is also a XXXX disparity in student borrowing that many experts say is problematic and the result of decades of systemic discrimination. '' ( XXXX on XXXX XXXX ). Then there are politicians such as XXXX XXXX who plan to put college legislation in place that will prohibit spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion ( DEI ) initiatives to make the atmosphere unpalatable to minorities and serve as another deterrent to the progression of marginalized people. \n\nWhile most of the impact of predatory lending lands on POCs ( People of XXXX ), all students who enter this system are preyed upon. Our family has over 10 years worth of experience with Discovers cruelty and unethical behavior. \n\nWhile regulatory scrutiny and fines from the CFPB have cast a spotlight on some of Discover Bank 's questionable practices ( as well as those of other lenders deemed predatory ), pinpointing the exact elements of their lending process that are illegal can be difficult. This is because their approach is often indirect and subtle, deliberately designed to maximize loan amounts at the expense of borrowers ' rights. While many individual aspects of their operations might not be explicitly illegal, their collective behavior can facilitate outcomes that are. \n\nDiscover 's tactics often seem calibrated to set students and their cosigners up for failure from the outset. For instance, their use of forbearance and hardship programs often lacks full disclosure regarding how these options will affect monthly payments and overall loan amounts, luring borrowers into a false sense of relief. Instead of offering extended loan term programs that would lower monthly payments while increasing the loan term, they opt for forbearancewhich more quickly inflates the overall loan amount. They have also been implicated in a class-action lawsuit related to DACA, alleging discrimination in mortgage and student loans. \n\nIn our personal experience, Discover had to correct inaccurately high interest rates and statement amounts for both of our children, adjustments that were made only after being flagged by the CFPB. Yet, these are not isolated incidents ; they represent broader systemic issues affecting a wide swath of borrowers, particularly those who are marginalized. The compounded effect is the widespread destruction of creditworthiness and a vicious cycle of financial disempowerment. \n\nWhile the CFPB has begun to address these problems, much remains to be done, especially considering the prevalence of predatory practices beyond just Discover. This is just the tip of the iceberg, but it's encouraging to know that regulatory agencies are watching closely. \n\nWhen a borrower opts for student loan forbearance, the aim is to temporarily suspend monthly payments. The terms may vary based on the lender and the loan type, and it's often the case that interest continues to accumulate during this period. The purpose of forbearance is to offer a short-term financial respite for borrowers going through economic difficulties. \n\nWhen our children sought more manageable monthly payments, Discover was quick to suggest forbearance, fully aware that this would result in higher monthly payments down the line, effectively trapping our children in a financial downward spiral while increasing Discover 's own profits. During my son 's final year of college, when he still had XXXX credit hours remaining, Discover insisted that he begin repaying his student loan. Despite his efforts to maintain interest-free deferment until he completed his education, Discover pushed for forbearance. We all fought strenuously to reverse this decision. \n\nDiscover didn't just encourage our children to opt for forbearance and their Hardship Assistance Program when they had a late monthly payment ; they did so when our children merely expressed difficulty with the existing payments. Because Discover fixed the loan term at 10 years, the deferred payments and interest accrued during the forbearance and hardship periods were later added to the principal. This inflated the monthly payments since the loan term remained unchanged. For both of my children, these strategies, combined with high interest rates, would have substantially inflated the loan amount compared to what was originally disbursed. \n\nOur Experience with Discover Student Loans : Discover, aware of the typical salary a graduate can expect in relation to the loan amount, commits students to a 10-year loan term and requires a cosigner. \nBoth the student and the cosigner undergo credit assessments for the loan, and we are informed that the interest rate range will be between 6.00 % and 9.00 %. Despite the cosigner having a high credit score in the upper 700s, the student is assigned an interest rate of 8.99 %. When questioned about the high rate and why the cosigner 's strong credit score wasn't considered, we are told that the student is the main borrower, not the cosigner. According to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, adding a cosigner with a strong credit score can substantially lower the interest ratepotentially by XXXX  percentage points or more. For example, a borrower with a credit score of XXXX could expect an interest rate between XXXX %, but adding a cosigner with a score of XXXX could reduce that rate to between XXXX %, resulting in significant savings. However, in our case, the student was given the maximum interest rate available at the time. ( This should be considered unethical, especially given the contradictory information provided later when the loan was due about the cosigner 's role as a \" co-borrower. \" ). \nRight after the student graduates, Discover reaches out to the cosigner for repayment, even before any payments are overdue. This approach raises questions about whether Discover had already anticipated that the student would fail to make payments. When queried about contacting the cosigner first, Discover labels us as \" co-borrowers. '' Ironically, we weren't considered co-borrowers during the loan assessment, which would have potentially lowered the interest rate, but we suddenly became co-borrowers when it was repayment timedespite our strong credit scores having no impact on the initial rate. \nThe student receives a staggering monthly bill of {$1200.00}, which is hard to manage on a $ XXXX salary. Discover suggests forbearance or hardship programs as a temporary fix. The representative glosses over important financial implications of forbearance, leading the student to opt for it without fully understanding its long-term impact. Six months later, the student is shocked to find out that monthly payments have increased, yet is advised to enter another round of forbearance or the Hardship Assistance Program, thereby exacerbating the situation. \nThe downward financial spiral starts almost immediately, as each forbearance period renders the loan increasingly unmanageable for both the student and cosigner. Their credit scores also suffer due to late or missed payments. \nAttempts to secure a XXXX consolidation loan through Discover failed because of low credit scoreswhich have been damaged by the student loansas well as the high total amount owed in relation to income, further worsened by repeated forbearance periods. \nEfforts to consolidate the student loans with other lenders also hit a wall due to poor credit and high loan-to-income ratios, which have been worsened by the initial loans and the forbearance cycles. \nBoth the students ' and cosigners ' prospects for stable employment and financial growth are compromised, as they struggle to balance loan repayment, daily living expenses, and retirement planning, all of which have been negatively impacted by Discover 's questionable practices. \nAs loan payments fall further behind, both students and cosigners experience harassment, misinformation, credit reporting errors, and other forms of mistreatment, violating their right to fair and dignified treatment. \n\nDiscover seems to understand the majority of students turning to them for loans are marginalized or underprivileged. Even when the loan was not in default, we were subjected to relentless harassment. Discover even unethically suggested that my children deliberately miss payments to exhibit financial hardship, employing strong-arm tactics such as bullying, credit damage, and falsehoods to extract money that arguably shouldn't have been due in the first place. \n\nThough attributing high interest rates and dismissing cosigner credit scores might be within legal bounds, it doesn't make it ethically sound. This, coupled with the dubious forbearance and hardship program policies, sketches out a blueprint of predatory lending that's genuinely unprecedented. Discover might try to pass the buck to its Collections department for any 'illegal ' activities, but it is its foundational policies that set up the damaging cycle leading to such harassment in the first place. \n\nOur daughter received two compensation letters from Discover, one on XX/XX/XXXX, and another on XX/XX/XXXX, seemingly propelled by CFPB 's scrutiny. However, this only occurred after she had defaulted, and the 'compensation ' was added back to her outstanding loan. My son also received a {$59.00} check from the CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX, for a related matter, along with four other letters from Discover acknowledging incorrect interest rate charges. \n\nWithin our household, both of our XXXX children, despite being XXXX years apart in age, have fallen prey to these tactics. This experience illuminates the systemic targeting of vulnerable populations like ours and others struggling financially. \n\nDiscover leverages this business model to infringe on the rights of borrowers, systematically inhibiting upward mobility for entire generations, including Millennials and XXXX XXXX, particularly those of XXXX. They gamble that few will have the courage or resources to oppose a financially robust institution backed by influential politicians. When similar outcomes manifest across millions of students, it's not the individual at faultit 's the predatory system they're ensnared in. \n\nRequest from Discover Student Loans : Release the hold on our credits, and dismiss all litigations now that we have an agreed-upon and executed settlement. \n\nIncluded in the attachments : 1.

However, because the statements were not going to my house but instead to the address provided by the fraudster, I had no knowledge of the theft. \n\nAt some point in XXXX 2022, Barclays issued a credit card with a different number under my legitimate account to a fraudulent authorized user. Under no circumstances did I request or provide information allowing an authorized user to be added. The fraudulent authorized user is XXXX XXXX and the address she is associated with is the same address my account was changed to in XXXX 2022. XXXX then attempted to add XXXX XXXX as another authorized user but was denied. I opened a formal complaint with Barclay in XXXX 2022 after I was denied a car loan due to delinquencies on my credit report, which were caused by XXXX 's theft. \n\nI spoke with Barclays multiple times inquiring about the investigation and the securities department at Barclays casually mentioned XXXX 's name stating she is a \" known name '' to them. During the fraud at Barclays, XXXX also falsely acquired my XXXX card information and stole close to {$40000.00}. I have finally been reimbursed for those debits through XXXX but Barclays is not reimbursing me. It is important to note that XXXX also funneled monies to my credit cards from other banks, including XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX would make direct payments from these banks and then use the payments to make cash advances at XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Texas and XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Texas. XXXX has defrauded customers of each of these banks and used my Advantage Aviator Red Mastercard to funnel the funds to herself. I insisted Barclays give me all the information, including transcripts, indicating how XXXX was able to make herself an authorized user. Barclays nonchalantly indicated XXXX had my information and was approved as a user. Truly, the largest disservice besides the theft is that each time I speak to Barclays, I have to jump through hoops and security authorizations before Barclays will have a discussion with me yet a known fraudster was able to quite easily make themselves an authorized user. Barclays securities department is clearly lacking the ability to protect its customers. \n\nIn XXXX 2022, Barclays sent a letter addressed to XXXX XXXX ( this was the first time XXXX was used but my statements as well as background checks have the name XXXX XXXX ) to my home address. The letter stated the primary account was closed due to suspicious activity and pending further investigation. This was the same account I reported to Barclays in XXXX 2022. Again, this is evidence of the incompetence within Barclays organization that they are now addressing a letter to me using the fraudster 's name. \n\nBarclays found fraudulent activity on my account and have not made any attempt to resolve the issue.

I appreciate PNCs detailed response and their efforts to address my concerns. However, there are several discrepancies and additional points that need clarification and resolution. \n\nTimeline and Communication Issues In PNCs response, it was stated that the Initial Assumption Request Form was received on XX/XX/XXXX. However, I submitted the initial assumption application form on XX/XX/XXXX. I realized I had forgotten to attach the divorce decree and followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, to correct this oversight. I followed up again on XX/XX/XXXX, as I had not received any response to my communications sent in XXXX. I have the email thread to support this timeline. \n\n\nRequest to Pause the Process My request to PNC was to pause the assumption process due to my layoff. I specifically asked for this to prevent further complications. Despite this request, the following occurred : On XX/XX/XXXX, PNC sent a Notice of Incomplete Application, requesting I unfreeze my XXXX credit report, sign and date the previously provided Intent To Proceed, and return the document by XX/XX/XXXX. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX, the assumption application was closed for incompleteness because the requested documentation was not received. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX, a new Initial Assumption Request Form was emailed to me. \nI was advised by XXXX over the phone not to take any action on this matter, as she was actively trying to help pause the assumption process. This advice directly conflicts with the subsequent actions taken by PNC, leading to further delays and confusion. \n\n\nConcerns About Representatives Advice and Communication In my initial complaint, I expressed concerns that a PNC representative suggested I should not have informed PNC about my layoff, which is misleading and potentially suggests mortgage fraud. While I appreciate that PNC has escalated this concern to the appropriate management level, I would like to be informed of the outcome of this investigation to ensure that such advice is not given to other customers in the future. \n\nAdditionally, XXXX never responded to any emails I sent her. She only followed up with me over the phone, calling at her convenience, allowing significant time to pass before following up with me.. I realize now that this was to avoid any sort of paper trail, as she made a lot of promises and statements to follow up with items during our phone conversations that I never heard back about. This included her commitment to putting a pause on the assumption and determining a way to avoid needing additional signatures from my abusive ex-husband. It was for my self-preservation that I specifically did not want him included in the process. \n\n\nCurrent Status and Emotional Impact I now have a new job and an offer letter, but I was not told what to do next, other than to complete the Initial Assumption Request Form that was sent to me four days ago, which is the exact same form I filled out and sent in XX/XX/XXXX. This form requires more signatures from my abusive ex-husband, which I had hoped to avoid. XXXX sympathized with this and understood the dynamic, and told me she would help me avoid needing his signatures in any way possible. It feels like I spent the last two months fighting for something that ultimately got me nowhere. If I hadnt made the original complaint in XXXX, I believe I would be in the same position I am today or possibly further down the process. It took months of effort, fighting, and phone calls for what seems to be no progress. \n\n\nIssues Not Fully Addressed - Competence of the Representative and Availability of Others : The response did not address the competence of the new representative or the difficulty I experienced in speaking with other representatives when I needed assistance. \n- Confusion Internally About the Process, Needs, and Timelines. \n- Application Fee : The response did not address the additional {$150.00} fee required to restart the assumption process, which I find unreasonable given the circumstances. \n\n\nComparison with XXXX Before my mortgage was sold to PNC on XX/XX/XXXX, I nearly completed the assumption process with XXXX. This process was significantly shorter and less expensive. I was less than two weeks away from finalizing everything when the loan was transferred to PNC. There was no understanding or assistance provided during this transition, aside from instructions on where to pay my bills. The lack of support and continuity during this transition period has been very challenging. XXXX only required a {$25.00} fee to run a credit check and only required my ex-husbands signature on the final closing paperwork. Additionally, I was told that their process overall would take approximately six weeks, which is much shorter than the six-plus months PNC has stated. I am very confused why the same process varies so significantly between companies. \n\n\nProposed Resolutions Given the above points, I request the following resolutions : - Clarification and Correction of the Timeline : Acknowledge the actual dates of my communications and submission of the initial assumption application form. Provide an accurate timeline for the remainder of the assumption process from now until close. \n- Pause the Assumption Process Without Penalty : Honor my initial request to pause the assumption process without requiring me to restart and incur additional fees. \nAllow me to send in updated information, including new job details and verification paperwork, as well as updated bank and credit card statements. This will be added to the already existing packet of paperwork I completed and returned to PNC on XX/XX/XXXX, and will continue with the assumption process from where I left off in XX/XX/XXXX. \nThis includes using the already signed request to assume a mortgage, the already completed assumption packet, the already paid application fee, and the previously requested credit report. \nIf it is mandatory to start the process over, then I request the additional application fee of {$150.00} be waived. To maintain my safety, I also request that PNC contact my abusive ex-husband for signatures. \n- Improved Communication and Support : Ensure that I receive clear and consistent information from knowledgeable representatives throughout the remainder of this process. I want to have an advocate for my best interests rather than someone who prioritizes the interests of PNC. \n- Outcome of Investigation : Inform me of the outcome of the investigation regarding the misleading advice given by the representative. \n\nI appreciate your attention to this matter.", "date_sent_to_company": "2024-05-21T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage", "sub_product": "Conventional home mortgage", "zip_code": "27617", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "9064070", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "PNC Bank N.A.", "date_received": "2024-05-21T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": null, "sub_issue": "Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue with the application process"}, "sort": [213567]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "9326176", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Credit card", "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/year> my computer and accounts were hacked and I tried to resolve the issue with USAA over fraudulent charges.

They did not clarify what information was inconsistent and told me to write a letter to a XXXX XXXX XXXX I asked to be able to email a manager or an actual person and was told only a letter could be sent.

To my surprise, I discovered a collection account that does not belong to me. I would like to bring to your attention that this entry violates the following consumer protection laws : 1.

In this case, the collection entry is erroneous and does not reflect my credit history accurately. \n\n2. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices. This includes reporting inaccurate information to credit bureaus, which has negatively impacted my creditworthiness. \n\n3. Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) : Under the FCBA, consumers have the right to dispute inaccurate charges and billing errors. The collection entry in question does not pertain to any debt that I have incurred, and therefore, it should be removed from my credit report. \n\n4. Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ) : The FACTA ensures that consumers have access to their credit reports and have the ability to dispute inaccurate information. I have taken the necessary steps to review my credit report and am exercising my right to dispute this collection entry. \n\nI request that TD Bank, as the creditor, take immediate action to investigate and rectify this error. I kindly ask that you provide me with a written response within 30 days, acknowledging the receipt of this dispute and informing me of the actions taken to resolve the matter. \n\nIn addition, I urge TD Bank to notify the credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) of the inaccuracy and request the removal of the collection entry from my credit reports.

Per my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically Sections 604 and 605B, I am requesting immediate action to rectify this situation. Firstly, I require documentation proving that I provided express written consent for Bank Of America to report the inquiry in question. As there is no evidence of such consent or a court order, I must assert that this inquiry lacks legitimacy and is thus subject to removal. Per the FCRA Section 605B, a consumer reporting agency must block the reporting of any information resulting from alleged identity theft when identified by the consumer. Therefore, I am formally notifying Bank Of America to remove this inquiry from my file within four business days. Furthermore, it has come to my attention that Bank Of America neglected to inform me of my right to rescission, as outlined in the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), specifically Regulation Z ( 12 CFR 1026.23 ). This allows me to revoke any rights waived, particularly those related to the security interest. I am requesting the CUSIP number associated with the security interest provided to Bank Of America. Failure to provide this information will leave me with no alternative but to initiate a level 3 audit on my account.

When we contacted BMO, we were told that it was a mistake and shouldn't have been filed, so we asked for a letter stating that the lien was removed and it was an error on their part.

Submission of Complaint : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a formal complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) regarding issues I have been facing with Bank of America 's practices related to my credit. \nXXXX. Bank of Americas Response : On XX/XX/year>, Bank of America contacted me to acknowledge that they had received the complaint. \nXXXX. Unauthorized Withdrawal : On XX/XX/year>, Bank of America withdrew {$1100.00} from my bank account without my knowledge or consent. This unauthorized withdrawal appears to be in direct retaliation to the complaint I submitted. \nThis unauthorized action by Bank of America has had several significant impacts : Financial Disruption : The unexpected withdrawal of {$1100.00} has jeopardized other scheduled bank drafts, causing potential overdrafts and additional financial stress. \nLack of Communication : Bank of America did not inform me of their intention to withdraw these funds, exacerbating the situation and demonstrating a lack of transparency and communication. \nRetaliatory Nature : The timing and nature of this withdrawal suggest that it was retaliatory, stemming from my complaint to the CFPB. This raises serious concerns about the bank 's commitment to ethical practices and accountability. \nAdditionally, Bank of America has consistently failed to take responsibility for the inaccurate information reported by credit bureaus. Their refusal to address these inaccuracies continues to harm my credit standing and overall financial health. \nI urge the CFPB to investigate this matter thoroughly. It is crucial to ensure that financial institutions adhere to fair practices and do not engage in retaliatory actions against consumers who exercise their right to submit complaints. \nPlease find attached all relevant documents, including a copy of my initial complaint, Bank of America 's response, and evidence of the unauthorized withdrawal from my account. \nThank you for your attention to this serious matter.

Below, I have outlined the events and concerns in detail : 1. Submission of Complaint : On XX/XX/2024, I submitted a formal complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) regarding issues I have been facing with Bank of America 's practices related to my credit. \n2. Bank of Americas Response : On XX/XX/2024, Bank of America contacted me to acknowledge that they had received the complaint. \n3. Unauthorized Withdrawal : On XX/XX/2024, Bank of America withdrew {$1100.00} from my bank account without my knowledge or consent. This unauthorized withdrawal appears to be in direct retaliation to the complaint I submitted. \n\nThis unauthorized action by Bank of America has had several significant impacts : Financial Disruption : The unexpected withdrawal of {$1100.00} has jeopardized other scheduled bank drafts, causing potential overdrafts and additional financial stress. \nLack of Communication : Bank of America did not inform me of their intention to withdraw these funds, exacerbating the situation and demonstrating a lack of transparency and communication. \nRetaliatory Nature : The timing and nature of this withdrawal suggest that it was retaliatory, stemming from my complaint to the CFPB. This raises serious concerns about the bank 's commitment to ethical practices and accountability. \n\nAdditionally, Bank of America has consistently failed to take responsibility for the inaccurate information reported by credit bureaus. Their refusal to address these inaccuracies continues to harm my credit standing and overall financial health. \nI urge the CFPB to investigate this matter thoroughly. It is crucial to ensure that financial institutions adhere to fair practices and do not engage in retaliatory actions against consumers who exercise their right to submit complaints. \n\nPlease find attached all relevant documents, including a copy of my initial complaint, Bank of America 's response, and evidence of the unauthorized withdrawal from my account. \n\nThank you for your attention to this serious matter.

I started a dispute for the charge and was initially given a credit. then on XXXX I received an notice that the vendor provided new evidence stating I did receive services and never requested a refund. Both of these statements were outright LIES. I had uploaded PROOF that I had been in contact, that they admitted they canceled the event and that I was to receive a refund. I showed enough proof in writing that should have been a very straightforward case. Yet, I was charged the money and the case was closed. Discover grossly mishandled this dispute.

Eventually he went over to his supervisor and said that he would send us the receipt which we were supposed to been had and a letter stating that the debt was satisfied. When we checked with the credit bureaus they updated the balance to an incorrect amount and it is still on our credit history. My concern is that they could never come up with a receipt and even after they accepted the settlement was paid they called me back after several phone calls trying to collect a debt, how do I know they will not try and contact me again trying to collect money.

I urge you to reconsider my eligibility for the Apple Credit Card based on my qualifications and merits as a consumer. Additionally, I would appreciate any assistance or guidance you can provide to address my concerns and rectify this situation. \n\nDiscrimination of any kind has no place in our society, and I trust that Apple values diversity and inclusivity. I hope that we can resolve this matter amicably and restore my confidence in your company 's commitment to fairness and equality.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a satisfactory resolution. \n\nIf requested i can send a copy of my current report.", "date_sent_to_company": "2024-05-03T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Getting a credit card", "sub_product": "General-purpose credit card or charge card", "zip_code": "27530", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "8921835", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA", "date_received": "2024-05-03T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": null, "sub_issue": "Application denied"}, "sort": [343301]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "6666925", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Checking or savings account", "complaint_what_happened": "On XXXX XXXX, I deposited a check from my utility company for {$6000.00} on the mobile app. I had a hard time these past couple of weeks because none of my appliances work and this caused me to spend more than I can afford, especially on food.

I received the affidavit two weeks later and got it notarized virtually using an app called XXXX that charged {$25.00} for a virtual service. I could not physically make it into a store to notarize because my husband works and uses the car, plus I have XXXX XXXX to take care of. After I got the affidavit notarized, I paid {$30.00} for certified mail so they could receive it the next day. My tracking receipt shows they received the form on XX/XX/2023. When I called to confirm, they said it was under review and would take seven business days to review. I called back on XX/XX/2023, and was on hold for three hours. Then the representative said it was notarized by someone in Texas and needed to be done in North Carolina, where I reside. I told her I paid {$25.00} for a virtual video service to get this done. Hence, people work from virtually anywhere to help get documents notarized asap if they can not physically make it to a location. She said they would be sending out another form so it could be done in NC. I then asked to close my account. After all, I am no longer interested in banking with a bank holding my money hostage for over a month, all because I wanted to transfer some of my funds. She said she would send a code to the phone number I have on file to close the account. The code never came, and she asked if I had an alternate number. I told her I only use one number on my account and have not had issues using this number in the past for my account.

As there is no evidence of such consent or a court order, I must assert that this inquiry lacks legitimacy and is thus subject to removal.\n\nPer the FCRA Section 605B, a consumer reporting agency must block the reporting of any information resulting from alleged identity theft when identified by the consumer. Therefore, I am formally notifying Barclays Bank to remove this inquiry from my file within four business days.\n\nFurthermore, it has come to my attention that Barclays Bank neglected to inform me of my right to rescission, as outlined in the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), specifically Regulation Z ( 12 CFR 1026.23 ). This allows me to revoke any rights waived, particularly those related to the security interest. I am requesting the CUSIP number associated with the security interest provided to Barclays Bank. Failure to provide this information will leave me with no alternative but to initiate a level 3 audit on my account.\n\nI expect prompt compliance with these requests to avoid further escalation of this matter.

I received notice that it was denied, on XX/XX/XXXX, so I called back and was told that they would correct the request, and resubmit, and I had to cancel with my insurance company. On XX/XX/XXXX, i got an email that it was denied again. I called back and was then advised that it would take 30 days to process, and that XXXX would not include the insurance, but it did. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with 2 mgrs - one named XXXX, who finally advised she contacted the insurance team and confirmed the HOA Master Policy was sufficient, and that the insurance team would clear it up witihin 30 days, as it had to go through the final steps, and any money owed would come back in a check. She told to continue paying the full amount in the interim. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, i received a call from \" XXXX - XXXX XXXX in PA '' stating she needs proof of insurance. I asked her why, she said she didnt know and transferred me to inurance. Insurance representative XXXX said she sees the policy was cancelled and the Master Policy was proven ok, so she transferred me back to customer service to get the policy removed. She merged customer service, - who said insurance would do it. XXXX XXXX wouldn't speak to me again, and the had her agent transfer me to insurance manager XXXX, who hung up on me. This is very unprofessional and high level incompetence. I will let social media know that BofA is a horrible morgage servicer, as my house is the only thing in jeopardy due to their incompetence.

When I looked at the posted transaction history, the last posted transaction was on XX/XX/XXXX.

While attempting to set up reoccurring payments, I noticed the transaction history showed the last posted transaction was still showing XX/XX/XXXX, and the past due balance was still showing XXXX. Now completely confused and concerned that maybe I did not click submit, I scheduled another payment. Now even more determined to set up reoccurring payments, the online portal was only giving me the option to use XXXX of XXXX external accounts that had been deleted. \n\nAs I am working through this, ( all on XX/XX/XXXX ) I received a notification that my PNC account was 30 days late. I log back into the portal and don't see any record of my most recent payment of XXXX. The transaction history is still showing XX/XX/XXXX as the date of the last payment. I attempted to make another payment and a pop up box appeared asking me to confirm if I wanted to make a duplicate payment so I opted out. \n\nAfter opting out there is prompt to view payment history. This view enabled me to see the XXXX payments for XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX which showed complete and the other payment on XX/XX/XXXX which was showing in process which I ended up canceling. ( This is different from the transaction history on the main home screen ) On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted PNC because my account is still showing past due XXXX. I informed them that the payments I have made online are not reflected in my current balance. The customer service rep confirmed that their online banking does not readily sync or process. She advised that it would take up to XXXX hours for them to see the transaction on their end. I let her know as a result of the glitches and outdated framework I have a 30 day late. I asked if there was anyone that could remove this information because technically my account is not past due. Additionally, I also let her know that the payment I initiated on XX/XX/XXXX never posted or processed. \n\nI was eventually transferred to an XXXX Banking technician who confirmed that their systems are outdated and they have a technology update scheduled to be rolled out in XXXX. He also confirmed this upcoming update should alleviate some of the pains we have. I am certain from a regulatory perspective they have identified technology risks that impacts customer experience. Additionally, the lag in processing and updates puts many of us at risk for having incorrect information sent to the bureaus. \n\nMy resolve to this was to set up reoccurring payments. The correct external account is not showing up on the external payments to complete a transfer. I was on the phone for over an hour to learn that because I'm not current I can't set up a reoccurring payment with the recently added external account even though my most recent payment of XXXX was showing complete and I used the very account to complete that payment.", "date_sent_to_company": "2024-07-01T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Incorrect information on your report", "sub_product": "Credit reporting", "zip_code": "280XX", "tags": "Servicemember", "complaint_id": "9401288", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "PNC Bank N.A.", "date_received": "2024-07-01T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": null, "sub_issue": "Account status incorrect"}, "sort": [411555]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "7088707", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports", "complaint_what_happened": "XXXX accordance with the fair credit Reporting act XXXX Account # XXXX, has violated my rights. \n\n15 USC 1681 Section 602 States I have the right to privacy.\n\n15 USC 1681 Section 604 A Section 2 : It also states a consumer reporting agency can not furnish an account without my written instructions.\n\n15 USC 1666B : A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose.", "date_sent_to_company": "2023-06-08T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Improper use of your report", "sub_product": "Credit reporting", "zip_code": "27215", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "7088707", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "DISCOVER BANK", "date_received": "2023-06-08T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": null, "sub_issue": "Reporting company used your report improperly"}, "sort": [413138]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "8457260", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports", "complaint_what_happened": "BANK OF AMERICA XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX \" I am opting out of your reporting services.\n\nAccording to the Fair Credit Reporting Act 15 USC 1681 section 602 a states \" There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy.

In one recent case, a bank argued the account holder authorized an EFT after an identity thief manipulated him into providing his bank information.

This action stands in direct contravention of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Fair Debt Collection Act, the Credit Privacy Act of 1974, and 15 USC 1681 ( b ). Such unauthorized sharing of personal data raises significant legal and ethical questions.Breach of Terms and Conditions : Furthermore, the bank has failed to uphold its own terms and conditions by denying me the right to opt out. This is a direct violation of 15 USC 6802-6805, demonstrating a disregard for the contractual obligations established between us.Continued Non-Compliance : Disturbingly, despite these concerns being brought to light, my non-public personal information is still being reported to third parties, as evidenced by my consumer report with XXXX consumer XXXXeporting agency. This persistence in non-compliance compounds the severity of the issue.In light of the aforementioned violations, I kindly request that BMO Harris Bank takes immediate corrective actions to rectify these breaches of privacy and adhere to the stipulations set forth by relevant laws and its own terms and conditions.Please consider this letter as my formal complaint and expect further legal action if these matters are not promptly addressed.

This legislation aims to protect individuals from identity theft and unauthorized use of personal information.\n\nI assert with certainty that I have not provided consent for BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE to report any information to my credit report. This lack of explicit permission constitutes a violation of my rights and could potentially damage my creditworthiness, in clear defiance of federal and state laws.\n\nI demand that BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE immediately ceases any further reporting of information to my credit report without obtaining my explicit consent, as mandated by Section 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA and Chapter 75A of the North Carolina General Statutes.

Im really just calling to clarify to make sure so my payment I just made was {$150.00} the minimum payment {$130.00} plus {$20.00} of a purchase to avoid interest on this cycle of XXXX. I called to clarify one agent gave me the wrong information said I need to pay my full balance without paying attention to the details of my account so then I ask to speak to a supervisor told me that I needed to pay {$6000.00} and something but that is the balance transfer that is under no interest for a year with the promotion she also told me its hard to avoid interest on a credit card its always a chance you can get charged interest which that isnt true either. I got so frustrated I hung up the phone. I called back and requested to speak to a supervisor and she told me that in needed to pay the minimum payment plus the balance transfer fees and the transaction/purchases I made but I told her the fees were paid with the balance transfer which isnt due until a year from the balance transfer date to avoid interest. I believe the {$150.00} payment is correct but your agents and supervisors needs to be more aware of my questions and how balance transfer work with promotion plus transaction/purchases to avoid interest. I just wanted clarification and they confused the situation even though I believe I understand what Im doing and the very first agent that explained to me when I made my first payment of {$800.00} something right after the balance transfer explain to me correctly. The agents I spoke to that gave me different confusing information makes me not want to ever due the balance transfer again. I know my transactions/purchases have a promotion on the interest but I still want to avoid interest all together so I know I need to pay minimum payment plus anything purchases I made in that billing cycle and I just wanted to be reassured.

In regards to the Pet Fee, when you and I had originally spoken and I had said that we would be paying for you to stay at the XXXX, you had asked me specifically what about your dog.

You would be responsible for any incidentals, room service, etc. Note, I do understand that XXXX did ultimately approve to have your pet fee added to our card. \n\nIn regards to your interactions with XXXX, please note that she does have witnesses in regards to her end of the conversation, and all parties have confirmed that she never cursed at you. She does acknowledge that she did raise her voice after you had called her disgusting, and for that I do apologize. No matter how anyone speaks to us, whether they are right or not, we do want to maintain our professionalism at all times and we have addressed this with her accordingly. With that being said, as had previously been discussed, it is not appropriate in any way to speak to any member of the XXXX XXXX team in a manner less than professional ( i.e. raised voice, insulting, threatening their employment, etc. ). \n\nIn regards to your move out, we have agreed to let you out of your lease early at no penalty, and without a full 30 day notice. We do need the attached move out forms completed in order to submit this. We will honor your move-out date of XX/XX/XXXX once we receive the attached forms back. However, we are not able to cancel someone else 's elevator reservation so that you can use the elevator during that time slot. Just like you, that person has taken the time to schedule their movers and book the elevator, and as reservations are completed on a first come, first served basis, we are not able to prioritize any one person over the other. On XX/XX/XXXX, we have the elevator available any time after XXXX XXXX. until XXXX XXXX ( with a hard stop at XXXX XXXX. ). Additionally, we currently have availability really anytime on the XXXX or XXXX from XXXX XXXX. to XXXX XXXX. ( again with a hard stop at XXXX XXXX ). Please let me know what time frame you have rescheduled with your movers so that we can get this reserved for you. Note, we can not stop someone else from booking those times while we wait to hear back from you on this so I do very much appreciate your immediate attention to this matter. \n\nAs you have made multiple comments to many members of our team in regards to a pending lawsuit, going forward, all future communication outside of regular day-to-day requests will need to go through our legal representatives. \n\nPlease let me know once you have confirmed an updated time with your movers, and I will be sure to get that reservation submitted for you. \n\n\n\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX | XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, North Carolina XXXX XXXX  XXXXXXXX | XXXX XXXXXXXX", "date_sent_to_company": "2023-12-01T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Took or threatened to take negative or legal action", "sub_product": "Rental debt", "zip_code": "28210", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "7872710", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "National Credit Systems,Inc.", "date_received": "2023-11-19T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": null, "sub_issue": "Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged"}, "sort": [543389]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "7861646", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports", "complaint_what_happened": "My purse including my personal information was stolen 2018, authorities were contacted with incident being reported, and a fraud alert was placed on my credit profile.

The account was opened in XX/XX/XXXX. Based on the structure of the account ( minimum balance + business saving account ), I was never charged any sort of fee to have the account in place. That being said, in XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America started charging me a {$16.00} fee in my account due to not meeting the minimum balance in the account ( XXXX average balance ). I was NEVER notified of this change, when I discussed with Bank of America representatives ( late XXXX, XXXX ), they indicated that the minimum deposit was ALWAYS XXXX ( it was not, as I wasn't charged a fee for ~3+ years ). As I do not actively use the account, I wasn't aware I was being charged a fee until earlier this year. At that point in time I contacted Bank of America and they refunded me {$48.00} in fees ( 3 months, {$16.00} each month ). Since XX/XX/XXXX I have been charged a total of {$400.00} in fees from the Bank, despite NEVER being notified of the change. It feels absolutely predatory in nature. I have more than ample funds in other accounts with the institution where I could shift funds around to avoid the fees, but, again, I was never made aware. I have been a customer with Bank of America for 20+ years and was an employee with the company for close to 10. This is simply not how you conduct business. If I can not get this corrected I will move my funds to another institution. I currently am employed by a competitor yet I have kept my funds with BAC. When I contacted BAC, I couldn't believe a representative was unable to tell me the specifics of when I started getting charged fees ( they claimed to have minimal history ) nor when the fee structure changed ( they claimed it never changed ). I had to spend time doing my own due diligence by sorting through years of monthly statements to ascertain the exact time in which the fees started and the totality of the fees charged. I look forward to bringing this issue to resolution and fully expect to be refunded the fees charged, in full, due to the lack of correspondence by Bank of America to make me aware that the minimum deposit balance had changed.

We will report to the credit bureaus that the account was closed by creditor, and credit your account with your card rewards balance if you have one. '' This action was taken without prior notice or any attempt to contact me for verification of my identity. \n\nHere are the specific issues I have encountered : Lack of Prior Notification and Verification Request : At no point did Discover Card communicate with me to request any form of identification or verification of personal information. I opened this account on XX/XX/XXXX, and have been making timely payments on this account for several months, indicating my active and responsible management of the account. \n\nUnwarranted Account Closure : Discover Card closed my account on the grounds of unverifiable personal information without providing an opportunity for me to address or correct the issue. This closure was abrupt and unjustified given my payment history and consistent account activity. \n\nNegative Impact on Credit Report : Despite claiming an inability to verify my personal information, Discover Card has reported the account closure to credit bureaus, indicating that the account was closed by the creditor. This action negatively impacts my credit score and overall credit history, which is particularly troubling since I have not been delinquent or irresponsible with my payments. \n\nExtenuating Circumstances : In XX/XX/XXXX, I was hospitalized with XXXX for 10 days and spent months recovering from related health issues. I have documentation to verify this if needed. Additionally, I had to return to the emergency room on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, due to complications from my illness. Due to my hospitalization and recovery, I missed the XXXX payment. Upon resuming my financial activities, I discovered that Discover Card had closed my account. \n\nIt is perplexing and concerning that Discover Card can claim they are unable to verify my personal information while simultaneously having enough information to report to the credit bureaus. Furthermore, at no time did Discover Card reach out to me to request any form of identification or verification to resolve this issue. \n\nGiven the above points, I believe Discover Card 's actions are not only unfair but potentially in violation of consumer protection laws.

On this call I was told that the account had been closed as I had requested, when in fact the account had not been closed. I have made several attempts since then to close my Nordstrom Visa Signature credit card account over the phone and Nordstroms Card Services continues to make excuses, transfer me to different departments and even tell me again that the card has been closed, when in fact it remains open. Nordstrom Card Services has deliberately refused my wishes and intentions to close my Nordstrom Visa Signature credit card ending in XXXX- on multiple occasions. I have recorded calls of the conversations and have been specific about my intention to have my credit card closed. More detail about this issue follows : In early XX/XX/2023, my Nordstrom Visa Signature card became unusable for purchases. It was frozen/locked for purchases, although I could still make payments. This was odd and not something that I anticipated. I called Nordstrom Card Services several times from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX asking for reasons why my account was frozen/locked. I was told that my account was \" under review '' and was given no explanation of why this was so or when the \" review '' will conclude. \n\nI had done nothing wrong with this account, have used the card in the same way for the multiple years that it has been open, have been a loyal Nordstrom customer, and have made all payments on time and have had an otherwise current and good account standing. \n\nI patiently waited weeks for the \" review '' of my account to conclude and on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX I called Nordstrom Card Services to close my consumer Nordstrom Visa Signature credit card ending in XXXX. \n\nI had made debit card payments in Nordstrom stores over the weekend ( XXXX XXXX ) to pay off my balance. In fact, to make sure there was no remaining balance, I overpaid on the account and had a credit/negative balance of approximately - {$400.00}. \n\nOn the call to Nordstrom Card Services on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX I asked the services agent on a recorded line if it was possible for me to close the account and was specifically told \" yes ''. I then proceeded with my request to close the account. Before concluding the call, I asked if the account was closed and the Nordstrom Card Services agent told me/verified that the account was closed. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called Nordstrom Card Services to double check that my account was closed and to my shock, learned the the account was not closed on XX/XX/XXXX as I had requested. I asked that the account be immediately closed. That closure again did not take place. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I also called Nordstrom 's Experience Line ( XXXX ) and left a message explaining the situation, inquiring as to why Nordstrom Card Services continues to defy my wishes and not close my credit card account, and also asking that my credit card account be immediately closed. The request for closure did not take place. This \" customer experience '' number appears to only have voicemail options available for inquiries. \n\nEarly on XX/XX/XXXX, I was on vacation outside of the XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. However on XX/XX/XXXX I received a voicemail from ( XXXX ) at Nordstrom Card Services saying the request to close the account effective \" today '' or on XX/XX/XXXX. This closure again DID NOT take place. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I again called Nordstrom Card Services and inquired about the situation and repeated my request to have my credit card account ending in XXXX to be immediately closed. On this call, I spoke with XXXX ( a card services representative in TX ) and was directly told - again - that my account had been closed. Later on the call I asked XXXX specifically when my account was closed, and she responded that the account had not been closed but was set to be closed on or by XX/XX/XXXX. I was astonished and couldn't believe that 1 ) my account had not been closed 2 ) I was again told that my credit card account had been closed when in fact it had NOT. \n\nThis is a similar pattern that Nordstrom Card Services is employing. I call in to Nordstrom Card Services and ask that my credit card account be immediately closed, they tell me it has been, but when I ask for more detailed information, then my account turns out to not have been closed. I asked for names of managers who have been connected with the decision to not grant my wishes and close my account and XXXX mentioned the name of a manager named XXXX or XXXX- a name that I've heard before - and someone who appears to be directly connected with the intentional decision to not close my credit card account against my explicit wishes to do so. \n\nI am asking that Nordstrom Card Services immediately close the account ( as requested by me, the consumer cardholder, and NOT a closure by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX \n\nWhat is also troubling here is that there appears to be an explicit attempt by managers like Evonne/Yvonne at Nordstrom Card Services to keep my account open against my wishes. This is absolutely deliberate. I would like a detailed explanation of why this has been done and who are the people responsible for doing so. I had hoped to close my account in peace and avoid a CFPB complaint and also legal recourse, but Nordstrom Card Services has continuously, consistently and blatantly denied my request for account closure.\n\nThis has been extremely stressful and time consuming. I have made several recorded calls to Nordstrom Card services asking for additional detail about why my explicit wishes to close the account that have not been followed. I have had take time away from work to communicate with Nordstrom Card Services, record calls, log written notes, and detail what has happened to my account. I have done nothing wrong, have been a good and loyal customer to Nordstroms, have always made payments to my Nordstroms credit card account on time, and have abided by payment terms and conditions that Nordstrom Card Services has set forth and have a current account in good standing. Yet Nordstrom Card Services has intentionally refused to abide by my repeated requests to close my credit card request.\n\nI have recorded my calls and interactions with Nordstrom Card Services and assume Nordstrom Card Services has recorded the calls too. There should be no discrepancy about my intent to close my credit card account or about the deliberate refusal of Nordstrom Card Services to abide by my wishes and close the account.", "date_sent_to_company": "2023-10-12T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Closing your account", "sub_product": "General-purpose credit card or charge card", "zip_code": "28209", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "7689180", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY", "date_received": "2023-10-12T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": null, "sub_issue": "Can't close your account"}, "sort": [622905]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "9916478", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Credit card", "complaint_what_happened": "This is a follow up to complaint number XXXX.

At some point it became a XXXX card and in XXXX the card issuer was changed from XXXX to First National Bank of Omaha ( FNBO ), see attached pdf XXXX XXXX - FNBO - XX/XX/XXXX. Note the XXXX off per gallon on fuel at XXXX. \n\nWe decided to drive to XXXX MO to visit our son. As planned, we left XXXX NC on XX/XX/XXXX, spent one night in XXXX TN and arrived in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The incident occurred near XXXX NC which is over 200 miles from XXXX, see pdf XXXX, North Carolina to XXXX, NC. We drove my wifes XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which has a fuel tank capacity of 14.5 gallons, see pdf XXXX XXXX XXXX Owner 's Manual. The distance from XXXX  to XXXX and the XXXX fuel capacity are important facts in this complaint. \n\nAdditional facts are to provide my normal spending pattern including dates, merchant locations, amounts ( gallons ) purchased and totals paid. These pdfs are attached : XXXX XXXX Billing Stmt XXXX XXXX XXXX Billing Stmt XXXX XXXX XXXX Receipts XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX You may note on the XXXX pdf that when the XXXX card switched from XXXX to FNBO several late fees were charged. I was used to a prominent green and yellow XXXX logo on the billing envelope such as the final XXXX bill of XX/XX/XXXX. The FNBO bills had no logo and the first one for XX/XX/XXXX was likely tossed out as junk mail see pdf XXXX XXXX Bill Delivery Envelopes. FNBO imposed late fees that I called and complained about and they credited them back. \n\nOn trips, I usually stop and fill the tank when the fuel gauge goes below and we used that method for the trip. When we left the freeway to buy gas I would check for a XXXX station and if the XXXX cent off per gallon was the best price, I would pull in to fill the tank. The incident occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. We were about XXXX miles from XXXX and pulled into what looked like a XXXX station see pdf XXXX 's # XXXX. It had the XXXX name and logo on the building, gas pumps, etc. When I put my XXXX card in the pump it did not drop all the prices by XXXX cents as it should. I thought the pump read the card wrong, so I canceled the purchase and tried again. Still no discount. I canceled again and went inside to get some help. The guy at the cash register had no clue about the XXXX XXXX cent discount. I asked more questions and he told me the station was not owned by XXXX, but some other company. I got back in the car and scribbled some notes on the back of a scrap of paper to perhaps complain to XXXX. The station owners name was unusual but most likely was XXXX. We drove on and did fill up at a XXXX in XXXX NC which is XXXX miles from XXXX see pdf XXXX, North Carolina to XXXX, NC. \n\nWe returned as planned to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. When I opened the XXXX XXXX Billing Stmt XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, to avoid interest and fee charges I paid the full amount due of {$250.00}, including {$90.00} for the XXXX XXXX charge dated XXXX. The charge stuck out since it was the highest since XX/XX/XXXX see XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and was allegedly made at that XXXX place. I immediately called FNBO and disputed the charge. They mailed a confirmation of the dispute, see pdf FNBO Letter XXXX. I expected that FNBO would quickly reimburse my account for the bogus {$90.00} and life would go on. \n\nFNBO sent another letter, see pdf FNBO Letter XXXX that said We have no recovery rights for card present, outside gas pumps, you will need to work directly with the merchant for resolution. If applicable. fees and finance charges that are refunded as a result of the dispute will appear on your monthly statement as well as your payment amount and due date. I have had credit cards for over 40 years and the issuing bank would not only handle such a dispute but would have notified me of a bogus charge and if the card was compromised they would cancel it, create a new account and send new cards. \n\nRather than correct the bogus charge they sent another letter, FNBO Letter XXXX. It alleges We have completed our investigation and at this time find the transactions to be valid. It was determined that your card was physically present at the time of these transactions and the chip on your card was read. These transactions are part of your normal spending pattern, took place in your home area. I dispute that entire statement. I did some research and on XX/XX/XXXX called the NC Dept. of Justice. They referred me to the FTC at XXXX who referred me to you at XXXX. I spoke with your service rep., XXXX who recommended that I file this complaint. \n\n1. The transactions are not valid. On XXXX I did not make any purchase, gasoline or other items at the XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX near XXXX, NC. \n2. The card was in my possession the entire time while I was at the XXXX # XXXX gas station. I did not let any one else even look at the card. It seems that someone was able to hack my card information, assume my identity and charge {$90.00} to my account. \n3. FNBO never provided any receipt for the {$90.00} charge so if it was a fuel purchase at the average NC price of {$3.00} per gallon, it would have been for 25.7 gallons. It would have been impossible to pump that much into a 14.5 gallon XXXX tank. Even if my car was totally empty then the price per gallon would have been {$6.00}. The highest price for regular unleaded in North Carolina history was {$4.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The highest price for Diesel fuel was {$4.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. \n4. My normal spending pattern for this XXXX/FNBO credit card is presented in the attached pdf XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Excluding the XXXX XXXX groceries of XX/XX/XXXX and the bogus XXXX charge of {$90.00} on XX/XX/XXXX the charges on my XXXX/FNBO card have been for XXXX gasoline and have ranged from {$30.00} to {$42.00}. The {$90.00} charge is over twice the maximum ( {$42.00} ) in that range. \n5. The bogus charge of {$90.00} at the XXXX # XXXX occurred over 200 miles from my home. If I drive even 60 miles from XXXX I consider myself to be out of my home area. \n6. On XX/XX/XXXX after leaving XXXX XXXX  XXXX I had to pull off for gas and went to the XXXX in XXXX NC where I pumped XXXX gallons to fill the tank, see XXXX XXXX Receipts XXXX - XXXX. It is 51.9 miles from XXXX to XXXX per XXXX, North Carolina to XXXX, NC XXXX maps. Our XXXX gets over 30 mpg, why would it only get 4.28 mpg from XXXX to XXXX? \n7.

I didnt commit any fraud but was scammed. This happened late last year. I do not have the precise dates or documentation as I discarded it not knowing that there was an agency that could help me. Bank of America must have all the records.\n\nI deposited two checks from XXXX mailed to me by a company that supposedly owed money to a person who I met in a dating site and that I had been communicating by phone and text as he said he lived in a city two hours away. I can provide all the details as to how I has tricked and misused by this person but Im not sure if you need that information at this point. \n\nI deposited a check for {$5000.00} in my savings account that was mailed to me by a company in Illinois that supposedly owed to my friend. I first went to XXXX to cash it but was told I couldnt as I did not have an account with them. I even gave the check to an employee of the bank and asked to confirm if it had funds and with the check in hand she did and said there were funds. She never noticed or said anything about it not being a valid check so I went to a Bank of America ATM and made the deposit. \n\nI later checked my accounts online and it said that the funds would be available in 5 days. A couple of days later I saw in my account that the check had been returned but not because of NSF. The back of the check said something like returned by holder. I did not received any call or communication from the bank about suspected fraud. \n\nI contacted my friend who apologized and said he was going to call the sender and check what was happening. He later said his lawyers had contacted the company that wrote the check and that they had agreed to send a check for {$40000.00} as payment for the total amount of money they owed which included the {$5000.00}. \n\nOnce I got it I tried to deposit it in the savings account but the ATM did not accept the deposit in that account but did accept it in my checking account. I didnt suspect anything and thought it was because my savings account had a very low balance. \n\nAgain online the deposit showed as pending as it would clear in 5 days. Again I didnt received any call from their fraud department. This check was also returned. \n\nI tried in the next few day to check my accounts online but didnt have access. I tried resetting the password and it accepted the change but didnt grant access so I went to the bank and was told that my accounts had been closed. I explained what happened and that by then I knew I had been scammed. The employee told me she couldnt change anything so I asked to open new accounts but wasnt possible as I had been flagged. She suggested to call the fraud department.\n\nI immediately did and explained the situation and told them I now suspected I had been scammed. The employee at the fraud department said that the checks were false and had not issued XXXX or the owner of that company. I told her I had not know that fact because nobody at Bank of America had contacted me warning me that the checks were false considering they suspected it and about 2 weeks had passed between deposits. That I hadnt commit any fraud and had not even tried to make any withdrawals or transfers because I wanted to make sure the payment cleared. I didnt understand how they could say it was fraud if no money had left my account and the bank had not been wronged in any way and that it was me who was the injured party. I also asked why, if they suspected fraud I wasnt contacted and made aware of their concern as they do with credit or debit cards. I was ignored and told that it was the bank policy and nothing could be done. \n\nAbout 10 days later I received letters from Bank of America stating that the accounts had been closed and attaching a check for the balance of each one. I was totally frustrated and angry because I had been wronged not only by the scammer but by the bank I had trusted for 20 years. \n\nI tried to open an account at XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX but wasnt approved so I had to finally open an account in a small local credit union that doesnt check either the credit bureaus or the company that informs the banking community. \n\nI believe that Bank of America acted incorrectly and unfairly and that their actions caused my personal credit to be affected and wronged me. \n\nPlease let me know if you require the complete details of the scam as well as personal information. \n\nThanks for helping.", "date_sent_to_company": "2023-05-06T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Closing an account", "sub_product": "Checking account", "zip_code": "27613", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "6937689", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION", "date_received": "2023-05-06T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": "Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response", "sub_issue": "Company closed your account"}, "sort": [636508]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "8665200", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Debt collection", "complaint_what_happened": "Ive contact the company who is reporting this debt on my credit they agreed to remove this this debt isnt mines Im not aware of this I dont owe any money this is hurting my credit and Ive ask for this to be removed Im also looking to get attorney because Ive been fighting this over a year nothing have been done about this this is false I went to that company that says I owe them and everytime I request for my paperwork they say tell whoever needs it to call them they want give me my own information so I had to call corporate on that office Im really fighting and now someone needs to do something this isnt my info this isnt my debt I really want this off my credit by law if nothing is proven it have to be removed from my credit report and they cant prove it nor do they supposed to sale my personal information I can get my lawyer involved and this is reporting inaccurate", "date_sent_to_company": "2024-03-31T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Attempts to collect debt not owed", "sub_product": "Rental debt", "zip_code": "274XX", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "8665200", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "National Credit Systems,Inc.", "date_received": "2024-03-31T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": null, "sub_issue": "Debt is not yours"}, "sort": [637702]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "6726334", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Credit card or prepaid card", "complaint_what_happened": "I completed a XXXX percent balance transfer offer in XXXX with no issues.

Then he asked me to send {$1500.00} to XXXX XXXX on XXXX. I tried, but I'd only used XXXX once or twice before, and I wasn't familiar with how to use it. I also had trouble linking it to my bank account. So he said it was fine, we could use XXXX, which was USAA 's preferred app, and he asked me to send {$500.00} to XXXX XXXX on that. Again, I tried, but I'd never used XXXX before, and I was having trouble with the bank not allowing the transfer. So he said it was fine, I had the money in my account anyway, so he asked me to go to XXXX and he'd send me the list when he got there. I did, and when I got there, he told me to buy XXXX {$500.00} XXXX XXXX cards at XXXX different registers. Then he asked me to open them up, scratch off the backs, and send him pictures of the receipts and the backs. After I did that, I realized this was probably a gift card scam, so I looked it up and realized that's exactly what it was. I blocked his phone number and email, filed a report with the FTC, called my bank and canceled my debit card, and called XXXX, but the funds were already gone from the gift cards, and they wouldn't reimburse me. I also reported the job on XXXX as a scam and called XXXX XXXX XXXX, but they said this didn't count as identity theft even though he had personal information about me from the job application, so they couldn't do anything for me.

I told USAA the whole story XX/XX/2024 and again when I called XX/XX/2024 because my account was locked, and on XX/XX/2024 the representative I spoke with said the account was locked because of my call as they were reviewing everything, and I would be getting a call from the fraud department within the next 24 hours. I never got that call. I ended up calling back XX/XX/2024 ( I worked XX/XX/2024, XX/XX/2024, XX/XX/2024, and XX/XX/2024 ), and I was told that they decided against me. Since I gave my permission, this didn't count as a scam, and fraud protection wouldn't cover the {$2000.00} that I lost. They read me the decision and a list of account restrictions I would have for the next 6 months, and if there was any more suspicious activity, they would terminate business with me. I never received that document in writing, via mail or my online portal. I then received a letter stating the check for {$8500.00} was fake, and I had to reimburse the bank that amount, so I called them again XX/XX/2024 about that. The representative checked, and there was a deposit for {$8500.00}, and when that was found to be fake, a debit of {$8500.00}, so that zeroed out, and I didn't owe the bank anything for that. But he said I had tried to move {$4600.00}. I guess he was adding up the failed transfers to XXXX and XXXX, which also were declined and reverted back to my account, so they XXXX  out, too. In the end, I have to cover the {$2000.00} I spent on the gift cards myself, and my checking account has a negative balance because of that. I have 45 days to resolve that negative balance, or USAA will terminate business with me. I'm not allowed to transfer money from my savings account to my checking account to resolve the negative balance, and they aren't automatically deducting from there, even though that's something they normally do in the case of an overdraft, and even the letter about the check said they would do that.

However, I have never been to that state, and I can provide phone records to prove that I was at work in my own state at the time. Immediately after discovering this fraudulent activity, I contacted Barclays to report the identity theft. \n\nThe following day, I received a credit alert notifying me that a Barclays XXXX XXXX credit card had been opened in my name. I promptly contacted Barclays again, filed a case with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), locked my credit file, and disputed all the charges. I was informed that the cases were under investigation. However, Barclays has failed to conduct a thorough investigation and has been unhelpful in resolving the issue. Their customer service representatives have been uncooperative and have provided vague responses. \n\nWhenever I report fraudulent activity, Barclays automatically issues new cards. However, even before I receive these new cards, I receive alerts that the cards have been used again. I have spent countless hours on the phone with Barclays, but they have not reached a resolution. To make matters worse, on XX/XX/XXXX, Barclays allowed a card that I had reported as fraud and was under investigation to be used, resulting in a loss of {$510.00}. These illegal activities seem to be specific to Barclays, leading me to suspect that an employee may be involved. \n\nBarclays informed me that the only mechanism they have in place is for me to report fraud when it occurs. Despite my requests, they refuse to refrain from issuing new cards under my name. I feel helpless as there seems to be no end in sight. Every morning, my first task is to check if any illegal activities have occurred in my Barclays accounts. I have provided Barclays with all the necessary documentation, including a police report, FTC report, and phone history to prove the origin of my calls and the steps I have taken to protect my credit since XX/XX/ 2023. However, Barclays has taken no responsibility for the situation and continues to claim that they can only act retroactively if someone opens an account in my name. \n\nFurthermore, the person responsible for this fraud also requested a credit increase on a card that I never requested.

This abrupt transition was executed without any prior notification, detailed explanation, final statement, or information about the status of my account before the transfer. As a customer who chose Goldman Sachs for its reputation, this lack of transparency and communication is deeply concerning and unacceptable. \n\nIssues Needing Immediate Address : Despite repeated attempts to contact Goldman Sachs for clarification, I have been consistently redirected to XXXX without any direct resolution. I require immediate and detailed answers to the following questions : - Payment History : A full history of my payments to Marcus by Goldman Sachs. \n- Account Balance : The latest account balance before the transfer to XXXX. \n- Interest Adjustment Inquiry : Clarification on the interest adjustment of - {$150.00} observed in my account with XXXX. I need to know whether this represents an increase or decrease in my interest. \n- Deferred Payment Program : An explanation of the status of the deferred payment reward program. Historically, after every 12 on-time payments, I was eligible for a deferred payment a key factor in my decision to stay with Marcus by Goldman Sachs . I need to understand the implications of this transition on my rewards. \n- Loan Payment Projection : An accurate projection of my loan payments with XXXX, ensuring that I am not subject to increased charges. \n- Interest Rate Confirmation : The exact interest rate that XXXX will apply to my loan going forward. \n- Apply a credit adjustment to the new XXXX account due to the losing ability of the on-time reward program. \n\nUDAAP Violation Concerns : The lack of communication and proper handling of this transition by Marcus by Goldman Sachs and XXXX constitutes potential violations under the Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices ( UDAAP ). As a result of this experience, I have lost trust in Marcus by Goldman Sachs and have moved my savings to another bank. \n\nRequest for CFPB Intervention : I urgently request the CFPBs intervention to obtain detailed clarifications on the aforementioned issues. It is important that consumers are treated fairly and transparently, especially in matters involving significant financial commitments like personal loans.\n\nConcerns Regarding Wider Implications for Consumers : Furthermore, I wish to express my deep concern regarding the broader implications of Goldman Sachs ' actions in abruptly unloading loans to third parties. This practice, particularly as it affects customers like myself who have maintained a flawless payment record, raises alarming questions about the financial stability and operational integrity of Goldman Sachs. Such actions not only undermine customer trust but also potentially signal financial distress within the institution. It is crucial for the CFPB and the general public to be aware of these practices, as they could be indicative of larger issues within Goldman Sachs that may affect numerous consumers. This situation warrants a thorough investigation, as it could pose significant risks to the financial well-being of many individuals who have entrusted Goldman Sachs with their financial needs.\n\nThank you for your attention to this serious matter.

I am giving clear instructions to GS Bank USA to update its tradeline to paid as agreed never late on my consumer report. Furthermore, now that I have educated GS Bank USA on its proper legal role as a consumer reporting agency under 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ), GS Bank USA has to launch an investigation into my dispute and disclose the results of the investigation no later than 30 days from receipt of this complaint. Failure to launch an investigation and follow my written instruction will be willful non-compliance under 15 U.S.C. 1681n ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), and under this provision, I am entitled to {$1000.00} per violation. Needless to say, GS Bank USA has racked up quite a few violations. I expect my written instructions to be followed immediately! I am fed up with GS Bank USA actions that are directly affecting my reputation and creditworthiness. Let me remind GS Bank USA that we are communicating through a government agency website. Please keep in mind what I said earlier about operating in good faith. To reiterate my demands regarding the handling of my consumer report, it is imperative that both parties operate in good faith and adhere to the legal obligations outlined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). As per my rights under 15 USC 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), I am directing GS Bank USA to promptly update its tradeline to paid as agreed never late on my consumer report. This action is non-negotiable and must be completed within 30 days. Furthermore, under 15 USC 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ), GS Bank USA is obligated to launch an investigation into my dispute and provide the results within 30 days of receipt. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in legal action and civil penalties.", "date_sent_to_company": "2024-03-27T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Improper use of your report", "sub_product": "Credit reporting", "zip_code": "28215", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "8627719", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with non-monetary relief", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA", "date_received": "2024-03-27T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": null, "sub_issue": "Reporting company used your report improperly"}, "sort": [669462]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "9100595", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Credit card", "complaint_what_happened": "Barclays sent an unsigned letter to me dated XX/XX/2024 stating that I did have the zero APR on purchases.

The caller ID showed USAA and I verified the phone number on XXXX, the USAA website, and the USAA mobile app so I trusted this phone call. I was told there were two attempts made to use my card at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, GA and they asked me to confirm if it was me. I explained it was not and it couldn't be possible as I live in XXXX, NC. They then began the process of having me validate information in order to send me a new card through the mail. While on the phone with this \" USAA representative '' they told me loans were applied for in my name, and immediately a mobile deposit was made to my checking account in the amount of {$4600.00}. I was told if I did not return these funds to the bank, I could be found liable and that I needed to return the funds via XXXX XXXX or XXXX. It was then I realized it was a fraud scam and immediately hung up. \n\nI then initiated a call to USAA immediately on the same day, XX/XX/XXXX to ( XXXX ) XXXX. I contacted this number because I no longer trusted the main line USAA number. I obtained this number from my father 's USAA banking card that lists this number for the Banking department ( images are attached ). Once I was connected with a real USAA representative from the Fraud Department, I detailed everything that occurred in the minutes prior. I was told my account was frozen, to change my password and pin numbers, and to attempt to move the rest of the money in my savings and checking account to any other account I may have in an effort to save it. At this time, I had {$1500.00} in my bank account. While on the phone, my savings account was completely emptied and the {$15.00} I had left in my checking account was also transferred out. The scammers completely took over my accounts. While I was still on the phone with the USAA representative, the scammers added an additional member to my account, XXXX XXXX, a phone number to the account XXXX, and a fraudulent checking accounting ending in # XXXX that all do NOT belong to me. The USAA representative was made aware of all of this and documented this on my account. For some reason, this fraudulent checking account was NOT removed from my account, nor was the phone number or newly added member, even after notifying the USAA representative while this was all happening. At this point, my account is frozen and the fraud department at USAA is looking into things. Additional deposits were being made to my checking account and transferred to the fraudulent checking account ending in XXXX. {$5000.00} via mobile deposit and {$2500.00}. Despite being told my account was frozen, deposits and transfers were still being made and USAA was allowing fraudulent checks to be deposited even after making them aware of this scam and account take over. I was not able to view any of the photos of these mobile deposited checks via the app or USAA website. When I called USAA, I was also told they were not able to view these checks either for whatever reason. I then received physical copies of these fraudulent checks via mail ( copies have been attached ). Neither of the checks are signed. One of the checks, is from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Florida and it is made out to ClearGrafx Printing. I have XXXX knowledge of these checks and don't understand why USAA allowed them to be deposited into my account. \n\nI called USAA again on XX/XX/XXXX to speak to the fraud department again and to the loan department to ensure I covered my bases. I was told there were XXXX loans applied for in my name. Both loans were personal loans I believe, XXXX in the amount of {$1200.00} and another in the amount of {$10000.00}. I was told the {$1200.00} was successfully funded, however the {$10000.00} loan was not yet approved and under revision. My credit was wrongfully pulled by USAA via XXXX for approval of these fraudulent loans and my credit score dropped approximately XXXX points due to this. The USAA representative ensured me they made several notes on my account in order to notify other USAA representatives working on these loans to NOT FUND any additional loans applied for. I continued to follow up with USAA frequently to get answers, but I was told there was nothing I or they could do. Once again, despite my account being frozen, turns out it was on a \" credit only '' status so funds XXXX be deposited, but not withdrawn. At this time, the scammers had over drafted my account- {$6600.00}. \n\nDespite having immediately updated my direct deposit information with my employer when this all happened on the XXXX of XXXX, payroll had already been conducted. With that being said, USAA accepted my paycheck totaling {$2200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and credited towards the negative balance in overdraft fees, again despite my account being \" frozen ''. Not only am I now left with XXXX XXXX  to my name due to the scammers draining my checking and savings accounts, I am now also being withheld my paycheck even after notifying the bank of this fraudulent activity. I called the bank yet again, and was told to submit my report to XXXX, which I submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive any communication back from USAA regarding this report. \n\nI placed freezes and fraud alerts with all three credit bureaus, filed a police report with XXXX, and even obtained XXXX. I changed my passwords immediately, called the bank, and tried taking all necessary steps to show this was fraud. Additionally, I will be reporting this to the Federal Trade Commission. Even after doing all of this and pleading my case, USAA is finding me liable, even after reviewing my case not once, but twice, for ALL of the fraudulent charges and loans incurred under my name. My account is scheduled to be closed XX/XX/XXXX. I was told I will need to pay off all of the overdraft fees and loans or they will report this to collections. USAA states they have a \" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' that states members are not liable for any unauthorized charges and in my experience, USAA is not adhering to this policy by choosing to find me liable for these unauthorized and fraudulent loans and overdraft fees. Again, the phone call I received was from a USAA main line and the caller ID was USAA. Whether this call was spoofed or not, USAA should also have additional safety measures in place to prevent this from happening.

My current internet provider is XXXX XXXX and installed on XX/XX/XXXX until now. \n\nI did ask XXXX to escalate this investigative fraud issue because there were two errors on the same day with my Merrill and XXXX XXXX accounts. I suspect this hack came from the same hacker ( s ). The hacker accessed my account sold my existing high-value stocks and used the cash to purchase cheap stocks, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX all of them XXXX shares were bought and sold in the same two days. \n\nWhy would this hacker do this way? I have discussed this issue with the police. Police said these hackers look like very smart and use this method to profit when stock prices rise and sell in the right way to make profits from the stock market and this way is difficult to catch cash flow. \n\nI did ask XXXX to submit more detailed evidence such as IP, IPS location, etc.. as well as their verified voice call records to offer to me how to support their decision. I will ask professionals around me to participate together to verify that. Looks like he did not want to be involved too much in my case, he told me Merill would give ma a formal mail for their conclusion. \n\nFinally, through the CFPB involved, I received a letter from Merril on XX/XX/XXXX, they closed my case because they had not found any computer-based online IP device fraud. Other than that, no more details, just one simple word that failed my claim case.\n\nSo far, The nearest response from Merill was on XX/XX/XXXX. In this response letter, it doesn't have any evidence to show me. It is a simple turn-off my claim case letter only. \nI request your organization to help me to find out the evidence for me at this moment. Thanks. \n\nHope to hear from you soon.

I reviewed ALL of the available detailed information on their website for the USAA XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card. USAA disclosed that funds for its secured credit card must be deposited into a certificate of deposit ( CD ). After reviewing the detailed information, I immediately explored their CD rates and noticed they offered a fixed 9 month CD at a rate of 4.50 % APY ; it was a no brainer that this was their highest yielding CD product and my preferred choice. I had {$1000.00} sent to my USAA account via XXXX then proceeded to open the 9 month CD via the mobile application. After opening the CD, I began the application process for the secured credit card. Upon being approved, the application informed me funds arent available in my USAA checking or savings account and I have until XX/XX/2023 to have funds made available. I contacted USAA credit card department and was informed I had opened the incorrect product and I would be transferred so that correct CD product could be opened and the old one be closed. I then spoke with a representative in their closure department and was told I was being transferred because they could simply have the CD converted into the correct CD product. Once I reached the department who would allegedly perform the conversion, I was told that was incorrect information and the CD would have to be closed so Ill be transferred back to the closure department. I then asked the representative to please explain that information to the representative Ill be transferred to considering I was just informed by that same department something totally different. Landing back to the closure department, I was then told since funds are coming from an internal account I would have to wait 7 business days so funds could be verified by the FDIC. This was alarming because this is normally the case for retirement or investment accounts. The representative then proceeded to tell me that once funds are verified, Ill also be charged an early withdrawal penalty. I then requested a supervisor or manager. I was transferred to their resolution department who confirmed that the information the previous representative provided me was correct and theres no manager or supervisor I could speak with.\n\nI am filing this complaint because USAA deliberately failed to mention the specific CD required in conjunction with their secured credit card so such errors could be made and penalties could be charged. Even while opening the CD, USAA asks the reason for opening the CD and again they failed to have an option available that states, to fund a secured credit card so that such errors could be caught early on during the application process. Theyre failing to disclose such details in their advertising and marketing information for the sole purpose of having the ability to charge penalties with no remorse or waiver of the early withdrawal penalty. Consumers deserve to be shared the specifics XXXX ) to avoid such error and XXXX ) while shopping around with other financial institutions that offers secured credit cards were able to compare rate of return on the products our security deposits are held in. Additionally, theres no reason that cash should undergo a 7 business days verification ; especially when being transferred from an internal USAA account. If authentication of funds is the reason for the hold then funds should not be able to be used to begin with. I could have easily kept transferring the funds to other checking or savings accounts in attempt to hide the original source of the funds and no hold would have been required then. Again, USAA only reason for such practices and lack of transparency in their marketing and advertising of their secured credit card is to capitalize off their members and charge these penalties.", "date_sent_to_company": "2023-03-30T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers", "sub_product": "General-purpose credit card or charge card", "zip_code": "28262", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "6772496", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION", "date_received": "2023-03-30T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": "Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law", "sub_issue": "Confusing or misleading advertising about the credit card"}, "sort": [679030]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "7270352", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Debt collection", "complaint_what_happened": "XX/XX/2021 1st progress/XXXX account # XXXX {$180.00} disputed to remove with my balance due to me.", "date_sent_to_company": "2023-08-24T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Attempts to collect debt not owed", "sub_product": "Other debt", "zip_code": "27401", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "7270352", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "Synovus Bank", "date_received": "2023-07-18T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": null, "sub_issue": "Debt was paid"}, "sort": [683714]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "6572768", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports", "complaint_what_happened": "BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX & fraudulently reported an inquiry on my credit report in violation of 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ) and 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ).

The account number, XXXX, was opened on XXXX. The late fees were attributed for XX/XX/2020 and XX/XX/2020, again after we had been awarded deferred payments. You can go back and look to see we had no late payments prior to that with the credit card or after those two incidents. At the same time, we had a personal loan, XXXX, through PNC that was awarded deferred payments by XXXX or XXXX in the loan department on XXXX in an attempt to consolidate the debt. We were advised that the XXXX and XXXX payments for XXXX would be deferred and we were never charged late payments for that endeavor. The loan was paid in full on XXXX. When we discovered the late payments, we immediately went to the XXXX XXXX to meet with XXXX XXXX. She immediately started apologizing and said she would get the situation rectified.

The creditor/subrogor and collection agent turned a blind eye to the previous notices of subrogation and equitable interest with the most recent being XXXX. In the process Adverse action was taken by the creditor for attempting to assert my rights, the account was closed when rights to interest and redemption were communicated. One who seeks equity must do equity. Equity will not suffer a wrong without a remedy. Equity follows the law. Principal and Agent are vicariously liable for the other. \n\nIn this era when credit has become one of the instrumentalities of business to which men pay homage, intangible property rights must be considered when conversion is discussed. Stocks, bonds, evidences of debt, debentures, insurance policies, contracts and other choses-in-action play a prominent role in present-day credit economy. Conversion has been defined as a \" wrongful interference over personal property, inconsistent with or in denial of the dominion of the person entitled to possession thereof. It is \" any dealing with the property of another which excludes the owner 's dominion. '' The gist of conversion is the unauthorized assumption of the powers of the true owner. '' A \" chose in action '' is a personal right not reduced to possession. For example, shares of stock, and debts represented by negotiable instruments and savings bankbooks are all choses in action. They are personal property rights, not reducible to immediate tangible possession, not capable of physical delivery ; but recoverable only in an action at equity or law. \n\nTrover  action will lie for the wrongful conversion of ... bonds, or other securities for the payment of money. This is true with regard to both negotiable and non-negotiable bonds. Even where bonds have been stolen, and a forged indorsement used to obtain new bonds from the corporation, the owner was allowed to recover the bonds from an innocent third party into whose hands the bonds had come. A bond being evidenced by a tangible writing, the courts have no trouble in finding the necessary dominion to allow an action for conversion. '' The underlying debt is immediately converted on the wrongful taking of a negotiable bond, and may be generally assumed to be converted in the case of a non-negotiable bond. \n\nTrover is a legal action that a property owner can take to recover the value of personal property that was wrongfully taken. The plaintiff must show that they had title or possession of the property at the time the action was filed. The plaintiff can sue the person who first converted the goods, or anyone else to whom the goods were delivered. Trover is different from other remedies for wrongful taking because the plaintiff only recovers the value of the property, not the property itself. The plaintiff can sue the person who first converted the goods, or anyone else to whom the goods were delivered. Today, the tort of conversion has subsumed both trover and detinue, and a plaintiff can request legal relief ( money damages ) or equitable relief ( return of property ). XXXXee, e.g. Burgess v. Small, 117 A.2d 344 ( Me. 1955 ) It has been well settled beyond controversy under the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States, and to issue circulating notes for the money borrowed; when XXXX borrowed We The Peoples private credit, it created a sovereign redemption and subrogation right in We The People and a breach of trust by the subrogors and mortgagees when they clog the We The Peoples right to redeem their collateral borrowed and the securities created on account by indorsement and interfere in commerce.

When it comes to accounts Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code has always applied to the sale of accounts. Revised Article 9 continues this rule in North Carolina 25-9-109 ( a ) ( 3 ). Former Article 9 defined accounts to include payment obligations arising out of only the sale of goods or the provision of services. Under the former law, this left many kinds of payment rights within the definition of general intangible. The sale of these types of payment rights often serves as a financing transaction, but former Article 9 did not apply to these transactions. Revised Article 9 broadens the definition of accounts to include : Payment obligations arising out of the sale, lease or license of all kinds of tangible and intangible personal property ( for example, account will include license fees payable for the use of software ), and Credit card receivables. \n\nThe sale of a payment intangible often functions as a financing transaction. Revised Article 9 brings certainty to these transactions by bringing the sale of a payment intangible into the scope of Article 9. However, to permit financial institutions that sell loan participations to avoid Truth is expressed in the form of an Affidavit. having a UCC-1 financing statement filed against them as debtors, Article 9 provides for the automatic perfection of a security interest created upon the sale of a payment intangible ( but not a security interest in a payment intangible given to secure an obligation ). G.S. 25-9-309 ( 3 ). \n\nNOTICE. EQUITY CONCERNS ITSELF WITH SUBSTANCE AND NOT FORM. Equitable Subrogation is forward-looking rooted in the equity maxim... equity regards done what ought to be done. Equitable subrogation is not founded upon contract, but is the creation of equity, and is enforced solely for accomplishing the end of substantial justice. It is the mode by which equity adopts to compel the ultimate payment of a debt by one who, in justice and good conscience, ought to pay. Equity delights in equality. Equity knows no time. Equity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber on their rights. \n\nTruth is expressed in the form of an Affidavit. See XXXX. XXXX ; XXXX. XXXX ; XXXX. XXXX ; XXXX. XXXX ; XXXX. XXXX ; XXXX XXXX. An un-rebutted affidavit stands as truth in commerce, equity, admiralty, XXXX XXXX and public policy. XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX ; XXXX. XXXX. Legal maxim : He who does not deny, admits. An un-rebutted affidavit is acted upon as the judgement in commerce, equity, admiralty, XXXX XXXX and public policy. XXXX XXXX. XXXX.

Thinking my autopay would kick back in. It did not and I was alerted in XXXX that my score had dropped due to a missed payment due to Barclays. I called to inquire why autopay did not take care of the monthly payment due and was informed it had been cancelled. It was then I was told, I should not have cancelled the autopay, that it would not have taken the additional money out if the balance was XXXX. Okay, lesson learned. The rep refunded my late payment and told me to write a letter to the dispute department to see if they could change the information sent to the credit bureau in light of the misunderstanding. I did just that and still have yet to receive a direct response from them concerning the matter. Funny thing is I paid the small balance in full a few days later and earlier than the due date. I left the autopay in place ( as I was instructed I should do ) and guess what? When my due date came along, they charged my account anyway, despite the fact I had a XXXX balance. HMMM!!! To top it off, they decreased my credit limit yet affecting my credit score once again. I felt XXXX valued. As a loyal Barclay 's member, who always pays on time and stays well below my credit limit, this was as isolated incident and XXXX due to an honest misunderstanding. I called yet again to understand why my limit would have been lowered because of this isolated incident and was informed it was because I had been delinquent for XXXX  months ( untrue ) and had too many derogatory marks on my credit report ( untrue ). Before they lowered my limit, my credit score was XXXX XXXX ( depending on which credit bureau XXXX I had a credit utilization rate below 19 % and I had no derogatory marks on my report. Besides this XXXX hiccup, my on time payment history was 100 % Does that sound like it warrants a decrease in credit limit. I'm not even upset that they have decreased my spending power, that's not a big deal.

A representation of me that they should not have the ability to affect or manipulate so easily. I am attaching several screen-prints of my credit score across several platforms.

During this Transfer, the account/routing number was transferred incorrectly, and as a result we were required to make a manual payment, visit a branch, and reach out to their service team on multiple occasions before they would accept our original billing information as an acceptable method for our recurring payment method. This was only the first of a multitude of frustrating and time consuming interactions with PNC, a servicer we did not choose or wish to work with. It took several weeks and many attempts for them to recognize our automatic payment method. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter stating that Hazard Insurance coverage verification was required for our property insurance to confirm our coverage. This was sent as a letter to us, and was put on us to resolve, requiring yet another call. PNC has the name of our insurance company and could have verified this themselves. I spoke to an agent who said they would confirm with our insurer and let me know- I never received a call or email to confirm. This was never an issue with our earlier insurance company. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received an escrow account statement including a check for {$6300.00}, leaving an {$860.00} balance in our escrow account. Our escrow total requirements were calculated on the previous owner 's reduced tax bill of {$1400.00}, leaving us without sufficient escrow balance to pay our property tax obligation of {$4300.00}. I called PNC - again - to see what to do with this - the value of the check had already been debited from our account. I was told to deposit the check into my checking account ( due to the amount I had to go in person to a branch of my XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX to do this, taking more time out of my day ) and then to pay it back to PNC to my escrow account. I have no idea how PNC would pay into just the escrow, so I asked if I could pay the property tax directly to the city and then resolve this with PNC afterwards for the following year. I was told this was OK. \n\nToday XX/XX/XXXX, I intend on making the payment to the county. Out of concern/hesitancy I check the PNC account and see a disbursement was made XXXX for the property tax bill, with an \" escrow advance '' from PNC of {$2700.00}. I check the county tax register and the tax bill has not been paid. I call PNC and speak to a supervisor who tells me that this is covered by PNC ( I check to confirm that this hasn't come out of the account we pay our mortgage from ) and am given a very vague answer and told to call the county myself to check on the tax status. I ask if our payment obligations monthly will be higher to account for their error to make up the {$2700.00} \" escrow advance '' to resupply the escrow for next year. They don't know and apparently \" are working on it ''. At this point I don't believe my taxes to be paid and I do not know what escrow payment I can expect and PNC representatives are kind but frankly unhelpful.

In the outline below I will provide details of both circumstances and the conversations ( text conversations ) and over the phone conversations with management. \n\nIssue # 1 : Servicing Issues First, I obtained the apple credit card in an effort to buy an XXXXXXXX XXXX with no interest. During that period, I made my payments on time. Due to the ease of use, I began utilizing the Apple Credit Card for other purchases and transactions. Over the last few months, and specifically in XXXX, I had to dispute a charge. \n\nMy complaint does not come from the dispute per se, rather, the complaint comes from the events following the resolution of the dispute. During the dispute process, I was not treated in a manner I came to expect from my card company. As a result, I closed the card. I want to make this clear, it was my decision. My payments were not delinquent nor was my card closed due to any issue with Goldman Sachs. I chose to close the card because I felt that the representatives ( which respond via text ) were not truthful, and more certainly knowledgeable, about the issues I was facing as payments were applied. I was unable to balance the card against the transactions from Goldman Sachs. \n\nAs a result of this, I closed the card. This occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. This was after multiple issues within payment postings and processings that were unaccounted for. When I would have text conversations with the card servicer, I was unable to resolve these issues. \n\nIn this particular instance, XXXX was being disputed due to a delivery not being made and I never received the product. I informed Goldman of this and was informed that I would need to file a dispute. I questioned this with representative and I also questioned a {$350.00} attempted charge that I was unable to understand why my card could not be used. It was at that point I realized that there were servicing issues and began deciding to close my card as a result. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX there were additional conversations about this dispute and I was becoming more irritated by the lack of knowledge and was informed I could either close the card or file a complaint. I was unsure what a complaint with the company would resolve and I decided to close the card. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I became increasingly concerned about the XXXX XXXX not being resolved, even though XXXX by this point had refunded the money to my account. This left an overage of {$1100.00} to my account. The amount refunded was {$1300.00} and {$560.00} and the original Balance adjustment was {$1900.00}. This should have been a wash. Additionally, a payment of {$3300.00} was made on XX/XX/XXXX which brought the account balance to XXXX. \n\nIN that time frame ( XXXX and XXXX ), I spent {$2200.00} and made {$2600.00} in payments : These payments were made on the following dates : XX/XX/XXXX : {$3300.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$920.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$700.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$100.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$650.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$140.00} This is {$360.00} more than I owed. However, I was informed that when the system processed the dispute, the payments on my original XXXX product were rejected. And somehow I now have a balance due of {$270.00}. \n\nNo one has been able to further explain the discrepancy in the numbers. On top of this, when I inquired about the problem I was told on XX/XX/XXXX that my account was submitted to the collections department and no one could help me at this time. I did, however, request a call back and a supervisor, XXXX called me back. \nI spoke with XXXX who acknowledged the mis-steps in the servicing of my account. He further said that another agent would need to review and call me back. AS of today, XX/XX/XXXX I have missed 2 calls in which the numbers come up as unavailable and I am not able to answer as I have those calls blocked on my phone due to privacy and protection issues. Would you give your information to an unavailable caller? I certainly hope not. \n\n\nECOA Violations On XX/XX/XXXX I inquired about re-applying for an apple card. Yes, as crazy as it seems, I was trying to take advantage of the 0 % financing for a new XXXX product. Remember, my dispute is not with XXXX, it is with Goldman Sachs. I was unable to find anyone with a similar financing option as apples plan. \nIn my text with XXXX at XXXX, I asked if I could APPLY for a new credit line. I was informed that : in order to reapply for an Apple Credit Card, then the balance would need to be paid off first. I asked So youre saying I am unable to apply? XXXX responded That is correct XXXX. Before reapplying, the account that was closed will need to have no pending transactions, no unposted interest and a balance of XXXX. Before these criteria are met, you will not see an option to reapply in your wallet. I advised that this is a direct violation of the ECOA and was disconnected ( without my consent ) from the chat box.

Approval odd were excellent, and I had several preapproval offers options from multiple other cards issuers to include other AAdvantage card. I have excellent credit and no issue obtaining credit elsewhere. I received a letter on XXXX XXXX from Barclay stating they need a Driver License/State/Gov ID, Social Security Card, current utility bill and bank statement to verify my address and had 30 days from date of letter ( XXXX XXXX ) to provide. The form letter had no phone number, no email address, no contact name, just a po box address to mail documents. This should have been my first flag, it just didn't feel right ; I attempted to call the customer service number on the website, but its a series of prompts that will not take you to a live person. I called the number for application status, that initially told me to reference a \" my status app link ''. I called back and got a live person who would not help me unless I submitted another credit application. I explained that I already have one, and she stated the system does not allow them to see applications already in process and that I can process a new one over the phone... why would I do that and take another credit hit. I tried two other numbers and finally got a live person when I called the fraud office. I spoke to them in detail about my concerns and was given a fax number to use and list of acceptable documents to verify identity and address. I faxed over clear & legible documents along with my contact info to confirm receipt. I called back a couple of days later and they still could not provide an update or confirm receipt. I was directed to XXXX the package which Barclays received on XXXX XXXX As the fraud rep directed, the package included the original letter, a letter asking them to contact me upon receipt, a copy of my military ID, copy of Passport, a Property Tax Statement, a water Bill XXXX and a XXXX XXXX  statement. ( Note : I did not have to provide this much information when I bought a house or car last year ). They did not follow up or contact me as requested, so I called them on XXXX XXXX, was bounced from person to person until I reach the security department, who then proceeded to tell me application was still on hold and they need more information and I now need to provide a a front and back copy of my social security card and current IRS 1040 document to further prove my identity as my military ID did not have my date on birth. I told them that should not matter as the DOB was on the passport which is legal proof of identity under the Real ID act. I was then connected to another representative, where I had to explain everything again. They assured me documents were for identity and not proof of employer or income. I explained that this was a lot of PII data that they are collecting, especially when documents already provided 100 % match info on credit report. I also wanted to know how PII was being protected under this process, Barclays answer was we will shred it when final decision is made or 6 months whichever comes first. I asked them to send me a letter stating why they needed more information as a SSN card is not considered legal proof of identity, and off course they refused to provided. I asked why a notice was not already sent as they had my identity documents for two week already, rep stated they only send one letter per applicant ( either a denial or request for information ) and had I not called back in, they would have just timed out my application & denied me with no further contact. Rep then proceeded to tell me they require this information from all applicants and it was standard business practice for identity verification. I immediately googled and no where could I find that this was a standard practice, to the contrary another Barclays site listed the same documents already provided as acceptable. Reached out to a few friends who have this card, and they were never asked for this information. I asked Barclay rep was there something in my profile triggering this, I would like to know so I can fix it and not have to go through this with another creditor. I was told they don't have to provide me with that information and that they can just deny the application if I wont provide them with a front and back copy of SSN card and/or 1040. ( note : the back of the card says protect card, prevent misuse, keep it in a safe place and never carry it with you ). If I had not found the Barclay 's number myself, I would swear this whole process was a fishing scam ; since when is a passport not considered ID, Military ID stop having DOB on them 15 years ago, a 1040 is not proof of identity as any one with XXXX XXXX can doctor a 1040. There is no legal requirement to even provide a social security number on the application, so how can they base approval or denial on not providing the actual SSN card. I asked why I could not use the identity verification app like other CC companies ( website says they have one ) I was told that was for current customer only despite the fact website clearly states for New Barclay Consumer wishing to apply for services. I was given yet another po box to mail updated document. I believe I am being profiled based on demographic information on the report ( military status, residential addresses, etc. ) as they wont disclose why I am being flagged. It almost seem like they are trying to make process difficult so I will give up which will give them justification to deny me. I have a 750+ credit score, 15 years of positive trade line, card utilization under 19 %, no late payments, great debt to income ratio, two inquires, no collections, so what's the issue. I have a high level government clearance and know the risk associated with collecting this much PII from one person ; If I had not called in, that paperwork would sit 6 month prior to being destroyed, who does paper anything in this day an age, and everything they are asking for now can be \" dummied up '' by a 13 year old. There was no option to elevate my issue or appeal the decision, either send the documents requested or don't. Again, the fact that I provided valid and recent identity documents as listed on the website/letter that did not clear the flag, coupled with the fact that they will not disclose what generated the flag over the phone or in writing leads me to believe there is a unfair process at play that needs to be investigated and corrected or organization sanctioned for its perceived profiling practices. I would have preferred an upfront denial over this current practice which puts my identity more at risk than issuing the credit card would have. If this \" identity validation practice '' is part of the screen out process for certain \" flagged group of consumers '' I would advise military, divorced women, minorities, and anyone choosing to live in an \" up and coming or investment neighbor '' to proceed with caution, you may be wasting your time and end up with a credit inquiry and no card.

At the time I scheduled the automated monthly payment to come out of my account automatically and those payment were made automatically through XX/XX/XXXX. At the time the account stayed active just like any other credit card I have, with no balance and I did not initiate an automatic pay feature cancellation. When I purchased my new device on XX/XX/XXXX, I was asked if I already had a XXXXXXXX XXXX account, which I did and had available credit to buy the new phones. I provided the information and at checkout it stated the monthly payment amounts, I agreed to the charge, and I received my phone. \n\nUp until XX/XX/XXXX, I thought that my account was being automatically drafted for the monthly payments that XXXX XXXX disclosed when I purchased my phone. They made it sound like, if I already had an account, then nothing would change. Like I shared earlier on this letter, I never changed any feature on my account, so automatic payment was my preferred method of payment, I didn't even have access to my online account. However, I opened a letter from TD Bank, who seems to be the credit issuer for this card, stating that my account was going to be sent to collections. Confused, I called the collections number, and asked my husband to help me with this situation. Through that discussion, we learned that TD Bank had cancelled their auto-pay feature on my account and when I purchased the new phones, despite what I was made to believe when I purchased my new phones, my account was not been automatically paid. The agent stated that there were letters sent to me but the only letter I received was the one I opened and resulted on the phone call I was making to them to resolve the situation. I explained that I opened the TD Bank letter because I found it odd that I kept getting so many of them - I have a TD Bank auto loan and I never open those because my bank sends the payment directly to them through e-bill. But now I was getting more than just 1 a month, so I decided to open it. Afterall, if anything, I would have been expecting a XXXX XXXX letter rather than a TD Bank one, and even then I probably would have thrown it in the trash because my account was setup with auto-pay... or so I thought. \n\nThey asked if I looked at the payments coming out of my account, and I explained that there are 37 payments that come out of my bank account on a monthly basis, and that there is always a balance available to make those payments, so I don't keep track of that. Additionally, most creditors will attempt to collect the debt past the due date by giving me a call, but no one called. It's as if they expected to reach me by sending off-brand letters that I thought were just car loan statements. Additionally, they shared that there were $ XXXX in late fees that the collector could only waive {$40.00}, recommended I made the payment to bring the account current to then call next day to a different number, talk to customer service to see if they would waive more. Although that sounded strange, I had no other choice. The agent helped me get access to my account, then recommended I made the payment with him or online. I asked if I made the payment online if he'd be able to waive the {$40.00}, and he stated that he wouldn't unless he saw the payment posted. I asked if he could just take care of it with me on the phone and then waive the payment- he said he could do that. Why wouldn't just tell me he could waive it if I made the payment on the phone is beyond me - someone should listen to the whole phone call, it is quite eye opening. \n\nOnce I made my payment, my husband informed him that we would go in and schedule the automatic payment shortly after the call. He advised not to do that, since their system was at risk of not being able to processing both the payment he was taking over the phone and the automatic payment scheduling. My husband then highlighted to him that it was insane that the system would XXXXXXXX XXXX something like that, although he wasn't surprised given the fact that the system also cancels the automatic payment as soon as the balance is setup which is contrary to the industry standard. He emphasized that the fact that their processes deviated from what consumers generally experience from credit card companies was causing financial harm to other customers- such as me - where consumers believe they are set to use auto-pay technologies to pay their credit card accounts, but how the process is designed and how the system handles user settings is so vastly different that consumers pay the price. The collector agent stated that he was not surprised since TD Bank technology was in fact very bad and it was not the first time he had seen issues with their processes and technology. \n\nI now have or will have derogatory marks on my credit report - despite many years of not missing 1 payment and having pristine credit. And there are still $ XXXX in late fees sitting in my account, but as a good citizen and responsible consumer, I went ahead and waited until today to re-setup the auto-pay they unilaterally cancelled on my account. I am willing and able to pay, I have not experienced a financial hardship and all of this could have been prevented if I wasn't deceived to think that the payments would be automatically drafted as a result of completing the purchase, nor that a credit card company would unilaterally cancel the auto-pay on an active account.", "date_sent_to_company": "2024-05-23T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Problem when making payments", "sub_product": "Store credit card", "zip_code": "XXXXX", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "9075780", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with monetary relief", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY", "date_received": "2024-05-23T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": null, "sub_issue": "Problem during payment process"}, "sort": [825252]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "7514694", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Prepaid card", "complaint_what_happened": "Yes I've been fighting with bank of America about this money since 2021 very tired of dealing with it and I would just like the money back they already ordered it in my favorite one time and they send a card out to a address that I don't even live at and that's not my fault so I'm still having to wait on my money even longer now they send me a check that is no good and I have to wait longer for it too as well I'm very disappointed and I think they should be investigated", "date_sent_to_company": "2023-09-07T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Problem with a purchase or transfer", "sub_product": "Government benefit card", "zip_code": "281XX", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "7514694", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with monetary relief", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION", "date_received": "2023-09-07T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": "Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response", "sub_issue": "Card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase or transfer"}, "sort": [825547]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "7593794", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Debt or credit management", "complaint_what_happened": "I was required to pay off my TD Auto loan in order to purchase a building for my business.

I believe it is crucial to bring this matter to your attention for swift resolution and to ensure the integrity of my banking experience. \n\nOn XX/XX/27, I visited the XXXX branch of Bank of America to address a situation related to a {$2200.00} money order purchased from XXXX XXXX. The money order was initially intended to cover my rent, but due to a change in my rental company 's policy, I needed to return the money order to my account. Following the guidance of the Bank of America staff at the branch, I made the necessary adjustments to the money order, replacing the rental company 's name with my own, and was assured that the funds would be deposited without any issues. \n\nUpon returning home, I received a call from the Bank of America fraud department for verification purposes. I provided the necessary information, explained the situation thoroughly, and was assured that everything was in order. I was told my funds would be available the next day. \n\nTo my dismay, I discovered that my account had been frozen, and the funds from the money orders were placed on hold. Confused and alarmed, I immediately contacted Bank of America customer service to seek clarification. Despite speaking with XXXX Bank of America employees previously who confirmed that everything was in order, I was informed that my account was now under investigation, and I would have to wait to call back in XXXX hours for some type of update. This delay poses a significant challenge for me, as I urgently need access to my funds to fulfill financial obligations, including rent payments.

Despite my appeals for assistance, I have been met with procedural delays and uncertainty about when this matter will be resolved. Regrettably, the customer service representatives I spoke with were not able to escalate the issue or provide a satisfactory resolution.

They had a company name and gave an original quote of {$1800.00}. It went up then to {$3300.00} by them adding the piano and other costs. On arrival, it was a u-haul, no named crew. They refused to give their names. They insisted on more cash for extras. Under duress, had me sign unfilled out papers, contract, that they would not sign or give names. The price went up to {$9300.00}! I was forced to give them the Barclay charge card for {$4100.00} or I \" would not see my stuff again. \" They picked up on Thursday, promised to be in NC on the following Tues. They told me to have a bank check or cash for {$4300.00}. I had a bank check ready.They never showed up for the whole week. I had three phone numbers from them that I called continuously. I left messages and no calls back, and a disconnected number. I ended up flying back to XXXX. When I arrived back on Friday night, someone called in a muffled voice saying he was the mover, would not give his name, said he would be in XXXX on Saturday morning at XXXX and I better have {$4300.00} in CASH or I wouldn't see my stuff. I had to go back to my credit union, who fortunately was open until 7 that night to get the bank check turned back into cash. I got on a plane from XXXX  back to XXXX to be there for their arrival. No one arrived at XXXX in XXXX. I again tried the numbers, no response. I called the police in XXXX. They said if they arrived, to call them if there was a problem. Upon arrival, it was a different crew, this time in a XXXX truck. Again, would not give names. They wouldn't turn truck off until they got the cash. Then insisted on more cash to get my piano off the truck. They threw my boxes, crushing everything. They broke all my furniture. When I tried to take pictures with my cellphone, I was shoved and they grabbed my phone, deleted everything and threw the phone. I called the police who came. I have a police report. \nWhen they left, they wanted more cash, but I had none left. The garage door was broken, ending up in an {$1800.00} repair. All of my antiques were smashed and had to be thrown out. Most all of the boxes were crushed and thrown in the garage and I ended up having to hire another company to help me move the boxes to their appropriate rooms. I have pictures of all of this. I have no numbers to call this company! On XXXX XXXX, it says they are out of business and others were scammed by them in the same way. They obviously have my {$4300.00} + cash that I gave them but I asked Barclay to put a stop payment on the {$4100.00}. Barclay originally did, but has since decided to pay them! I don't know how they have any contact information from them. \nI sent Barclay all of the information, the reports, the pictures, etc. about 30 pages of information. The reason they said I still owe them is because they said the company performed their service!!! I asked Barclay who made that decision, and they said I was not privy to that information. When asked to reopen the case with the new information, they sent a letter saying they still would not refund me the money. I don't understand how the moving company can get away with this, which is despicable at best, but more likely criminal.

The representative stated she added the notes, explained how a previsionary credit works and the initial timeframe of 10 days for your funds to be replaced while the situation is investigated, Again I expressed 10 days to wait would be a definite problem for me and she advised she would escalate the complaint.

At this point, your contrary claims can only be characterized as a willful disregard for the unambiguous language and decades of case law interpretation of the FCRA. \n\nLet me reiterate in full detail exactly how Bank of America irrefutably qualifies as a CRA to avoid any possibility of further confusion or misrepresentation on your part : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( f ), a CRA is defined as \" any person which, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties. '' It is indisputable that Bank of America furnishes consumer credit data, including payment history and account balance information, to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX on a regular basis. Furnishing such consumer reports to credit bureaus is considered \" engaging ... in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information ... for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports. '' XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ). \n\nFurther, multiple circuit courts have affirmed that this definition of a CRA includes furnishers of information like XXXX. See, e.g., XXXX v. XXXX XXXX. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) ; XXXX v. XXXX XXXX. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ). \n\nTo remove all doubt, the Federal Trade Commission 's ( FTC ) official commentary on the FCRA definition of a CRA explicitly states that furnishers of information, such as creditors, landlords, and employers, meet the definition : \" they are CRAs and they must comply with all applicable requirements imposed by the FCRA and its implementing regulations. '' 16 CFR Part 600, Appendix. \n\nThe inescapable truth is that by furnishing consumer data to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, XXXX XXXX in every sense \" regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information... for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports '' and thus qualifies unequivocally as a CRA under 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( f ) with all attendant legal duties. \n\nTo continue denying this legal reality exposes Bank of America to serious liability, including potential FTC enforcement actions and class action lawsuits. I urge you again to acknowledge the facts and remedy your non-compliance without further delay. My detailed outline of the law leaves no room remaining for doubt or excuse.

This representative informed me that I had been previously misinformed and I could go online to my account page and update the beneficiary ( POD ) there. \n\nI attempted to update my POD online. The online banking site informed me I could not update my POD online and should call USAA directly. After two calls of being misdirected to the wrong support staff, I reached a customer support representative. This representative attempted to update my POD with my accounts but informed me the, 'system is down ' and to call back later. That representative informed me that, despite me having previously designated my brother as POD over a decade ago, I have no current POD designated. \n\nON XX/XX/XXXX, I managed to reach a USAA representative by phone ( after a 32 minute hold ). That representative tried to update my POD for me but came back and read to me from her computer terminal, \" software unavailable at this time ''. We were unable to complete the action. The representative reaffirmed to me that USAA has no record of me having designated a POD to my accounts. I recall having done so around XXXX. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I recieved a telephone call from someone representing themselves as a customer support representative from the USAA \" CEO 's office ''. I explained my situation and she was apologetic and said she would complete my request for designation of a POD on my accounts. After being on the liine for more than 30 minutes, she came back to me and said she was unable to complete my request. She stated she would need to transfer me to another department and asked if my spouse ( the new POD designee ) would be available to 'answer questions '. I became suspicious. \n\nI also discussed with this representative that the existing POD on my accounts had mysteriously dropped from my accounts in XX/XX/XXXX. I had researched this from my old statements to confirm that, in fact, my brother had been designated as POD up until XX/XX/XXXX but had mysteriously dropped off after that date. This was without my action or me being notified. \n\nThe representative placed me on hold and further researched. She came back and said she discovered my brother as POD had vanished after XX/XX/XXXX ( I had found it to be XX/XX/XXXX ; not sure of the discrepancy ). We ended the call with the USAA repXXXX directing me to call back and ask for a different department. I no longer have confidence in USAA 's ability to help me. \n\nMost troubling - I have gone years without a beneficiary ( POD ) on my accounts when I had expressly designated one. They dropped my POD unilaterally without telling me.", "date_sent_to_company": "2023-06-02T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Managing an account", "sub_product": "Other banking product or service", "zip_code": "27205", "tags": "Older American", "complaint_id": "7062365", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION", "date_received": "2023-06-02T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": "Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law", "sub_issue": "Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed"}, "sort": [847418]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "6517821", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Debt collection", "complaint_what_happened": "XXXX XXXX sold a claimed debt for renting a home to National Credit System .They sold a debt claiming l owed them $ XXXXNational Credit system put this said debt on my credit report without verification of the debt.This caused me to lose the house l was going to get because it messed up my credit.Then XXXX XXXX  send me send me a letter that l didnt owe them {$4900.00} dollars l owed them {$2100.00}.

It landed in my XXXX XXXX Credit Card instead of my checking account, because it was said that when I transfer from their end instead of Bank of America it can't go directly to my credit card. I contacted XXXX XXXX Credit Card customer service the next day when I noticed that issue. When I called XXXX XXXX, to request them to get understanding and then to request that they send the {$1000.00} to my checking account as it was intended to go to from the beginning, they said sure but they had to call Bank of America on three way to verify the funds were clear. We made the call, and on XX/XX/2023 the very next day Bank of America confirmed with XXXX XXXX that the funds were cleared as the day before, XX/XX/2023. XX/XX/2023, Bank of America was still using the {$1000.00} that was cleared XX/XX/2023, that I transferred on XX/XX/2023 immediately and the {$1000.00} showed up on my XXXX XXXX Credit Card same day right away. XX/XX/2023 Bank of America send an email ( that I didn't see until days later after seeing XXXX subtracted {$1000.00} from my account ) saying I didn't have enough money in my account. XX/XX/2023 XXXX XXXX sent a notification saying the \" funds transfer has been returned to XXXX XXXX '' from Bank of America to XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$1000.00} and said return reason was \" Insufficient Funds. '' We called on three way to try and handle the situation, Bank of America said I could add XXXX XXXX to the account so that I could transfer the money back to them, I tried to do it while they were on the phone and it said that I couldn't link the account both times that I tried although I've transferred before. So I took {$960.00} out of my Bank of America while on the phone and put it on my XXXX card, leaving {$39.00} in my Bank of America account and waiting until it cleared so that I could withdraw what was left and close the account. I then transferred that money immediately to my XXXX XXXX Checking ( I already had money in that account ). All this to say, Bank of America was double dipping in that money, causing XXXX XXXX to charge me an extra {$1000.00} on my credit card which also made my credit card balance be maxed out messing up my credit when I just got my credit to go up a lot of points, and because the \" changed their mind '' about my funds being cleared a day before and decided to hold on to those funds. The {$1000.00} was reversed from my checking and credit card. Also, I made a cash deposit into Bank of America in the amount of {$130.00} and immediately withdrew {$120.00} the same day. Bank of America has on my statement that I deposited {$130.00} on XX/XX/2023 and withdrew {$120.00} on XX/XX/2023, how is any of that even possible. Summary : I am demanding that money back for that bad mishandling of money and having me to have to lose {$1000.00} that I was saving, also, putting wrong dates of transactions, withdraws and deposits, changing dates. Causing all this stress for the past month, for me losing money to drive around not only to Bank Of America, but all the way from XXXX to XXXX NC to XXXX XXXX, losing money by transferring from XXXX immediately, causing my credit card to Max out, my credit score to drop points, printing out all of my transactions from my end, slowing down my process of having that money for a deposit on a place, potentially delaying my process of having a good standing relationship with my new credit card and more.", "date_sent_to_company": "2023-08-29T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Managing an account", "sub_product": "Checking account", "zip_code": "28405", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "7466838", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION", "date_received": "2023-08-29T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": "Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response", "sub_issue": "Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed"}, "sort": [894530]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "7639942", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Checking or savings account", "complaint_what_happened": "Here at bank of America I made a deposit for checking and savings account plan time plus, at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX And all unauthorized transactions action on account and debit cards in was frauded.", "date_sent_to_company": "2023-10-04T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Closing an account", "sub_product": "Checking account", "zip_code": "28213", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "7639942", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION", "date_received": "2023-10-04T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": "Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response", "sub_issue": "Funds not received from closed account"}, "sort": [897944]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "6477542", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Credit card or prepaid card", "complaint_what_happened": "For months the company continues to take unauthorized payments from my checking account.

For context : this check was provided to me by my grandmother 's financial company themselves, as she was gifting me money to help with the deposit and closing costs of my new home. Upon deposit, I received XXXX emails from the bank : XXXX telling me the deposit was received, and XXXX telling me the deposit was approved. A few days later, I try to log into my account to see whether the funds were available yet or not, but I wasn't able to login. After multiple attempts trying different passwords, usernames, etc., I finally decided to call the customer service line to reset my password - thinking I had completely forgotten it. To my shock, the customer service representative informs me that that my ENTIRE account has been frozen and my check deposit was under \" fraud investigation ''. Effective immediately, I could not login to my account online, couldn't access any of the funds I had in the account ( via withdrawal, debit card usage or otherwise ), and obviously wasn't able to use any of the large check that I desperately needed to move forward on the home. I was forwarded to a fraud analyst who explained it typically takes XXXX business days to resolve the matter, but my hands ( and my account ) were tied until then - there was nothing I could do. Mind you : the only notification I received from the company was a letter that came XXXX weeks later in the mail - no email, no phone call, nothing. Over the course of the next XXXX  days, I reach out for an update multiple times ( XXXX I would say ), getting the same spiel from whoever I spoke to that day : typically XXXX  days, at most XXXX. I even had XXXX analyst inform me to expect a resolution at exactly the XXXXbusiness day mark - XX/XX/year> - citing the date exactly. Sure enough, I try to log on the XXXX and am unable to once again. I reach out to the customer service line AGAIN, and I am told that there is ONCE AGAIN no update on the investigation. This time, I'm told it could take up to XXXX  days from the initial deposit- which had previously been relayed to me as an anomaly. Meanwhile, I am having to push back the purchase/closing of my new home. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I reach out again for an update. After a period of being on hold, I am told that after my call on the XXXX, they reassigned my case to a different team. With this reassignment, it could now be an ADDITIONAL XXXX DAYS before resolution. I lost it. I understand verifying the funds, absolutely, but for it to now be a month and they are telling me it could be double the time I've already waited is absolutely ridiculous. People 's livelihood depends on the money in their accounts + the money they deposit, and thank God, I have other bank accounts with better companies that I can rely on for my day-to-day expenses. This has been an absolute nightmare, and not XXXX person I've spoken to has given me a clear guide/timeline/explanation for the issue and the resolution. I've even asked if I can cancel the deposit entirely- nope. As I mentioned to the analyst I spoke to today, AS SOON as my check is in my account, I will be withdrawing all of the funds and will never ever, ever even think about banking with this horrible company again.

Approximately one year after purchasing the vehicle I was contacted by a representative of BOA and informed that I had missed a payment. Upon review of my bank records, I could find no evidence of a payment being missed. I requested BOA provide me with a statement or evidence to show the missing payment. BOA failed to provide such evidence. I was again contacted by BOA several months later again alleging that a payment had been missed. Again, I went through the payment history with the representative who determined that no payments had been missed and apologized for the confusion. Several months later I was again contacted by BOA alleging a payment had been missed. The representative was extremely aggressive and informed me that a late fee of {$15.00} would be accrued for each month the payment remained delinquent. Again, I requested proof of the delinquent payment which again was never provided by BOA. This same scenario repeated at least two more times. I requested proof of the missed payment no less than four times, to which BOA repeated failed to provide such proof. \n\nThe term of my loan ended XX/XX/XXXX ; however, BOA has continued to draft a monthly payment from my checking account. I contacted BOA on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  by phone. The representative, XXXX, again reviewed my payment history and could find no missing payments. XXXX confirmed that the term of the loan expired in XX/XX/XXXX, and speculated that the reason I continued to have payments drafted from my checking account was because of the late fees which had accrued over the past five years. XXXX was unable to waive the late fees and stated that he had never seen anything like this. XXXX offered to submit this to a higher department for review. Other representatives have stated the same in the past, but I never received any response ( this seems to be a BOA tactic for getting customers off the phone without resolving their issue ). \n\nAt the time the vehicle was purchased, the dealership mixed up the VIN number of my vehicle with another vehicle on the lot. This required the loan information/docs to be resubmitted to BOA. It appears that BOA failed to update the payment schedule and at no time reached out to me regarding any issues. \n\nBOA has engaged in unethical practices and has continued to harass me for over four years by phone and by email. Despite multiple representatives of BOA acknowledging the problem, at no time did BOA take corrective action. The aforesaid representative, XXXX, implied that, although this is a BOA error, I would still have to pay the erroneous late fees before the loan would be forgiving and the title to my vehicle released. \n\nAttached is a copy of a letter sent to BOA on XX/XX/XXXX, and served upon BOA 's registered agent on XX/XX/XXXX, and the USPS Certified Mail return receipt as evidence of service. In the letter I once again requested proof of the missed payment or release of the title within thirty days from receipt of the letter. As of the date of this complaint, BOA has failed to respond. I ask that your office investigate this matter and take corrective action against BOA for unethical practices. \n\nThank you for your attention and assistance in this matter.

I told her I wanted to get taken care of today. I paid {$1500.00} today. My fear that is not the late fees either.

After the forbearance ended, XXXX XXXX and Midland Mortgage both failed to conduct any type of formal review of financial circumstances, ability to pay or provide access to any government programs that they are required to make available to struggling borrowers. Instead of conducting a review XXXX XXXX kicked the can down the road and sold the loan to Midland Mortgage. Instead of working with me to provide options to address the payments that had been set aside due to forbearance Midland told me there were no programs available and that I must pay full reinstatement to stop the loan from going into foreclosure. This is a violation of the CARES act that was mandated by the government, Midland is required as servicer to provide options to recapitalize or defer the missed payments or to consider a loan modification or repayment plan. This never happened. \n\nI have worked as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for 10 years and my wife XXXX is a stay at home mom caring for our XXXX children ranging in age from XXXX to XXXX. Within a month or two of Covid outbreak in spring 2020 many of the workers caught covid and unable to work and it started infecting the entire crew. To date I have had it XXXX times and my wife XXXX times. When I first got sick they made me quarantine and would have to get a positive test then wait two weeks before I went back. When my wife was sick and there was no in person school I would have to stay home to take care of the kids because we could not afford day care. At that time I contacted previous lender XXXX XXXX and they told me about the CARES act forbearance which helped us out for XXXX months. I ended up having to renew the six month forbearance 3 times because I was still struggling financially due to the impact of XXXX. \n\nWhen the last forbearance ended in XXXX I asked XXXX XXXX about resuming payments, and they said that I should just hold off on payments and they were going to look at a loan modification that would roll the payments back into the balance of the loan. After several months I contacted XXXX XXXX again to ask if they needed to review my financial documents or if they needed anything to review me for assistance and they said no. They were not sending me delinquent notices or attempting collections and I trusted them and waited. They never requested financial information, they never gave me any answer or feedback on the review that was allegedly being conducted and instead next thing I knew was that the loan was being transferred to Midland. I tried to talk to Midland agents about looking at a loan modification. Instead of providing access to government homeowner assistance programs as required their agents obstructed the process and denied my family access to the government programs that should have been made available. I was told that the only option was full reinstatement, in direct violation of CARES act forbearance guidelines.

I have a screen shot showing this ; the result makes me suspect that these issues are systemic/software based. Nonetheless I contacted XXXX to make sure there was no blockages or restrictions on my account. I can confirm that there was nothing in XXXX systems blocking these actions. I then reached out to Discover letting them know that I was having issues adding my bank account to pay my bill. I gave them my XXXX account information and they told me that my account was either not active or prohibited. This means I had to prove the account was active by reaching out to XXXX and merging the call. The call ended up dropping for some reason and I had to restart. I was able to get both parties ( Discover & XXXX ) to be on the call together. They verified my information and validated that my account was active. The Discover representative informed me that the payment would go through and I don't have to do anything else or worry. I have emails confirming the payment went through from my XXXX bank account on the XXXX, from Discover. I check a few days later on the app and see that I am still late on a payment. I was confused and realized that the payment didn't go through. I end up using the debit card for my XXXX account to pay the now late monthly payment. I shouldn't have been late if Discover systems accepted the validated XXXX account information. Also if that method didn't work it is Discover 's responsibility to reach out immediately with alternatives. Now I have a delinquency on my credit report for something I had no control of. When I call Discover and inquire about them removing it they say that they can't because \" its not a Discover error, its a bank error ''. Technically it would be a Discover error because they asked for the wrong information and didn't contact me in reasonable time to address the issue. Also my bank has no showings that Discover returned any payments from the XXXX. The odd part is that all the information I provided was correct and cosigned by a bank member. Its Discovers prerogative to ensure that the proper measures are taken and that means asking for relevant information. The ruling is that Discover made no mistake since they couldn't locate my account based off the information I provided. I only provided the information they asked for, if they understood the situation more and requested the right things this probably wouldn't have happened. They still are blaming XXXX which I don't understand because they had no influence on the payment being made. This negative on my report is invalid because all the information I provided for the account holding the funds was correct. So you either blame Discovers system or their representatives ignorance for the way the situation unraveled. To make things worse the calls were recorded and played back. All the information was proven to be right, but Discover 's system still failed to locate my bank account. It was my first ever late payment and I had no real liability in the situation. I took a lot of time and effort trying to make the payment to avoid the credit tank. To make things worse Discover hasn't provided any evidence that my bank returned or denied a pull for the funds. Like I mentioned earlier I have emails confirming payments made from XXXX on the XXXX, that were sent from Discover. I need to get this off my record because I actually attempted the payment with the resources they offered, mind you before the deadline.

I first spoke with her on XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX EST and the last about XXXX mins. She received the same attached letter/complaint. She said that she reviewed it and my account and I needed to change my account because it was linked to my grandmother 's mortgage. I then asked the question again that no one could seem to answer ( not even XXXX XXXX ), when did my account change or was updated? To my knowledge no changes can be made on the account without my permission and I never agreed to link my account to my grandmother 's mortgage. She did not have an answer other than I need to change the account. \n\nPreviously to speaking to XXXX, I went into the bank and spoke with banker, XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The information that he gave me and that he received from his manager was totally different. At this point it seemed that everyone was on the same page about changing my account, but no one had an answer as to why it needed to be changed or when it was changed/updated. He said the only thing that he could think of is that it was an error on Bank of America 's part. He said that there was no way my account could be changed or updated with my permission and my grandmother 's mortgage shouldn't have anything to do with my account. He suggested that the only way to avoid the fee for XXXX was to change the account-again without any real reason or rhyme. The only reason I changed the account was because I didn't want to have to deal with the run around and I was in the process of closing the account after all payments for XXXX had been processed. XXXX said that he stood on his word and he apologized that I was going through this. As far as the Advantage Maintenance fee that was charged, he saw it was processing so I should hear about it soon. \n\n\nI received a callback from XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. She said that she went back and listened to my previous conversations with customer service and it was noted that the representatives informed me that I needed to change my account so they would not be reimbursing me the maintenance fee because it was valid. I again asked her when was my account changed and she still didn't have an answer. She was just very adamant about the fee was valid. I let her know about the conversation I had with the banker and XXXX XXXX even accused her co-worker of misinforming me. She said that my bank account statements forewarned me about the fees. I asked her for a yes or no answer-so looking at my statement that said Regular Checking-Advantage Relationship let me know that I am going to be charged {$25.00}? Of course she couldn't answer that with a yes or no. She proceeded to cut me off and rush me off the phone. I did not like how she handled the conversation at all because at the end of the day there was no answer... no.resolve! \n\nIn all that has been said my point is there was no direct or clear explanation as to why I have been charged with the fees from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. It is more than {$25.00}, it is the principle. It is not fair to withdraw fees from my account wrongfully. In all the conversations no one could produce evidence with my permission to change/update/link my account to my grandmother. It is stated on the website that accounts will not be linked without permission/consent. This process has been long and drawn out for no reason. This matter could have easily been resolved, but thos institution rather take fees out of my count ( and maybe many others ) because they think that we are helpless and will not stand up for what is right. \n\nThank you for your time and cooperation.", "date_sent_to_company": "2023-01-19T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Managing an account", "sub_product": "Checking account", "zip_code": "28273", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "6452126", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION", "date_received": "2023-01-19T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": "Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response", "sub_issue": "Fee problem"}, "sort": [961084]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "6541171", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Checking or savings account", "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/2023 Bank of America told me they were closing my account because someone had tried to deposit a fraudulent check but they returned it and that I had to stop my direct deposits.

First Phone attempt : On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I reached out to Goldman Sachs via the XXXX contact number provided upon account lockout. I spoke to a representative and was transferred to their security department. I was notified that Marcus needed to verify my identity via my phone number. I provided the number that I was calling from, that was also used to create the account. I was told that The number provided does not meet our criteria to verify your account. The representative told me that I needed to wait XXXX business days for a representative to reach out regarding the status of my claim. Case Number : XXXX. My first reaction was that it was standard practice, until a quick XXXX search revealed this happens to many people, and money is held for months at a time. \n\nXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX- No representative has reached out since the original call was made. Additional attempts to access the account were unsuccessful. I made an additional phone call via the same contact information provided by Marcus by Goldman Sachs. After being passed from the original operator to the appropriate department, I explained the scenario above to the representative from the security department. She asked me a series of questions to verify the information on the account, including my full name, date of birth, and last four of SSN. I provided all of the information. I also provided the last four of the case number. Again, I was told that my phone number did not meet the criteria to verify identity. The operator, XXXX, stated that there was another verification method via my Drivers License. XXXX asked me what state the Drivers License was from. I replied, North Carolina. She stated that North Carolina does not meet the criteria to verify my identity via Drivers License. Additionally, she stated that on my first phone call, I was misinformed by a representative, and needed to wait an additional XXXX business days for a reviewer to verify my identity. I asked for copies of the recorded conversation that we had, and she said that it was not an available option. The conversation ended. \n\nXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX- I called back one additional time to attempt to verify my identity via an alternate phone number. After reconnecting to the security department. I let the representative know that I could verify my identity via an alternate phone number. The representative let me know that there were XXXX other phone numbers listed, and asked if I had access to either one. I had never provided either numbers to XXXX by Goldman Sachs, and am unsure where they gathered that information. They provided the last XXXX digits only for XXXX separate numbers : XXXX, and XXXX. I responded that I still had access to XXXX of the numbers ( XXXX ) that belonged to a family member. I read off both numbers in their entirety as XXXX, and XXXX. Both numbers were offered as possible verification numbers. Not until after I read off the number, did the representative state that all of a sudden those number no longer met the criteria to verify your identity. The representative transferred me to a supervisor ( XXXX? Pronounced key ). This supervisor also notified me that the number was ineligible for identity. I proceeded to inform her that I was prepared to provide SSN, XXXX, Department of Defense ID Number, Tourist Passport Number, Official Passport Number, and NC XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX responded that the only method to verify my identity was via phone number. I asked that if none of the phone numbers I could access were eligible for identity verification, how would Marcus confirm my identity. She stated that a reviewer would reach out and ask questions that only I would know. Im not sure what that means considering I have all of my legal documentation and forms of identification in front of me. I asked the supervisor if all of the funds could be transferred back to the same account they were deposited from. She said that was only possible once my identity was verified. I proceeded to ask to speak to her supervisor. She responded that she did not have a supervisor, rather that she was the supervisor. Upon pressing further she said that her supervisor was Marcus by Goldman Sachs and that they were unavailable. She stated that the back office was to review my case and that there was nothing she could do. I asked to speak to a supervisor from the back office and she said that there was no such supervisor. I finally asked for a guarantee that my account would be reviewed within the next XXXX business days and she responded in the affirmative.

Just the dispute mark, not the debt itself. I was taking ownership of the debt. I had originally disputed this with the credit bureau, so I called them first to have the disputed mark removed not the debt. They did their process and it was done fairly quickly, I called National Credit Systems that day after speaking with all 3 credit bureaus to inform them not to report it as disputed as a heads up. National Credit systems sent me to the Law Offices of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. in GA. and I spoke with XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX was very rude to me on the phone as I was just informing them not to report it as disputed. XXXX XXXX XXXX states : \" We are not on your credit file therefore if you disputed it with the credit bureaus you will need to speak to them ''. I said, \" Sir I understand what you are saying, however, National Credit Systems directed me to you because you have my account and are managing it, therefore you can make sure that is not reported as disputed because that is not accurate reporting ''. XXXX XXXX XXXX repeated himself and was very rude to me, it is all in the recording. I then asked for a Supervisor and asked him how long is the wait 24 to 48 hours? I can wait no worries. XXXX XXXX XXXX said \" I will not send you to a supervisor because they will tell you the same thing ''. I then asked \" XXXX XXXX XXXX are you denying me a supervisor call? He responded with \" Sir I can send you to one right now, you are all over the place sir. '' he then transfers me to a supervisor whose name I don't remember and he also said the same thing and i said can you guys take a settlement or a payment plan? the supervisor says let me check and asks how much can I pay? I said probably about XXXX maybe. He said \" No call me when you get closer to the balance '' So we then start talking about the age of the debt and the 7 years and I told him : \" I would not be able to pay more until it's probably closer to the 7 years or if they take a lower settlement if at all ''. The supervisor says : \" Well then they will probably get a move on it then '' I took that kind of language as a lawsuit and it caused me more stress on top of what they had already caused me. So now I'm stuck where no one is willing to help me and I start to feel stressed. I decided to wait to see what the bureaus do. I then had the mortgage company run my credit again and it was showing up again as disputed at this time I was speaking with either XXXX or XXXX  when the woman said that National Credit Systems had reported it that the Sunday of last week as disputed. So I redo the process again and I call National Credit Systems afterward to inform them of what happened and that they reported it again as disputed causing me more stress and financial burden because I have to pay for every time the report is pulled. I spoke with the National Credit systems Operator who then sends me back to the same XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I get XXXX XXXX XXXX again. XXXX XXXX XXXX again as I tried to explain the situation and how National Credit Systems reported it again as disputed after I called them and called all 3 credit bureaus. XXXX XXXX XXXX repeated again what was mentioned above \" They are not showing on my credit file, therefore they can't help me ''. However, they are collecting on behalf of National Credit systems and NAtional Credit Systems keeps sending me to them. He then says : \" I can send you the credit bureaus information to call them ''. XXXX XXXX XXXX was not listening to me and what I was trying to tell him. I then asked, \" XXXX XXXX XXXX, I understand what you're trying to tell me but that has already been done, who can I speak to about this dispute mark to make sure they stop inaccurately reporting it? XXXX XXXX XXXX states : \" Sir you can speak to whoever you want to speak to in the world but I can not help you or give you any advice '' So I told him \" if you inaccurately report this again I will file a lawsuit against your agency ''. At this point I was so stressed I could not even think straight, this is not good at all that this office does this violent collection practices. So I call National Credit Systems and inform the operator that they do not want to help me or say they can't help me and XXXX states that \" they can help me '' and proceeded to read a note on the account that they placed that reads : \" That I do not wish to speak to them '' which is also completely Inaccurate. XXXX then gives me a phone number to call who is a direct line to XXXX XXXX XXXX apparently when I dialed XXXX XXXX XXXX and I left him a voice mail and he has not yer return my call. Please review these calls from Friday XX/XX/2023 and Monday of this week XX/XX/XXXX. It's all there. PLEASE HELP ME with this I don't know who else to turn to about this!

In XXXX, XXXX, with $ XXXX in my bank account from selling my home, I went to a store to finance a couch set for 12 months at no interest in the amount of {$2800.00}. The store ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC ) used TD Bank d/b/a XXXX I received my statement and input my account number and routing number intending to pay $ XXXX to pay it off in roughly 6 months. My payment never processed, and I was told I was late. I am never late. I called the company to remit the payment over the phone. To my surprise, that did not work either. Frustrated, in XXXX, XXXX, I called to remit the payment in full which was now up to approximately {$2900.00}. That was not returned either and I was told there were no issues showing on their side with the account. It's also worth noting, that I could not see what the issue was either as the Acc/Routing numbers are semi-redacted with \" XXXX. '' Fast forward to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I ended up remitting a total of {$3400.00} after re-submitting my account information. Remember, I at all times had the money t0 pay for the couches in full. I am fortunate to make a six-figure salary as well. \n\nPresent day -- I am applying for a home loan and see that my account was marked \" derogatory '' for failure to make payments on time. I was and am livid. How could this be when I attempted so many times to pay the couch in full? Well, after 7-8 phone calls with pleasant but unhelpful representatives, I find out that there was one digit incorrectly input in my original input from XXXX, XXXX. That one digit was the source of my late payments, NSF assessments, and ultimately, a \" derogatory '' account mark on my and my wife 's credit scores. I was previously above XXXX and am now in the XXXX 's. I am being forced to pay an increased loan origination fee of roughly {$3700.00} with my home lender because of this derogatory account marker on my account. \n\nIt seems to me that a consumer finance company should have measures in place to assist customers that actively try to pay their credit card accounts but experience typographical or technological issues.

And now, the company has made an additional {$600.00} from the late fees, and I am being cost {$3700.00} more that I would not have had to pay otherwise. \n\nMy complaint is based in failure to diligently assess customer behavior. I was very clearly attempting to make my payment. But that was of no consequence to this company. It's a sad world where companies destroy peoples credit and unfairly cost them money.

Further this is a formal complaint requesting immediately release of the funds held for what they deemed a security hold. \nFrom a business transaction, I was provided a cashiers check drawn from PNC bank. On XX/XX/XXXX, My XXXX and I was told by the banker at PNC on XXXX XXXX in XXXX, NC that a 2 % fee of the total check would be charged to cash the CASHIERS CHECK. This was a major concern because the amount to cash it would exceed {$2000.00}. We voiced our concerns and the banker shared that opening an account could present as a better choice. She further collaborated the banks policy via the online website. To avoid the fee, a new joint checking account for my fianc and I was opened and the Certified PNC Cashiers Check was deposited into this account. \nThe credits from this deposit were made available the next dayXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX  XX/XX/XXXX ) On the following day ( XX/XX/XXXX ), my XXXX and I elected to make a wire transfer from this account to our XXXX XXXX account. The original goal was to transfer an amount and not the entirety. We went into the PNC bank in XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX and sat with a PNC Banker. When we sat down we felt like we were already being profiled. We shared we wanted to make a wire to an external account. The banker looked into our account seemed to be looking for a reason to not make the transfer. He looked up at us like we couldnt do the wire. He immediately said oh we got to verify the funds as if we had done something wrong. At this point he was profiling. It wasnt an issue before. As if people of XXXX can not have credits in the bank, as if people of XXXX are doing unlawful things to have credits in accounts, as if people of color/account holders can not electronically transfer credits that belong to them. This became uncomfortable. He had not taken the time to assess our concern but profiled us and took issue with the amount we were seeking to transfer. I responded based on his actions, demeanor, and gestures, we want to immediately close the account and wire the total credits to the XXXX XXXX account. The banker walked out and returned with his superior. The superior expressed that she needed to again verify funds. After a small wait time, the verification was complete and the banker expressed he would proceed. I called in his presence, XXXX XXXX and spoke with a representative about the incoming wire. I was sent documentation along with wiring instructions for an incoming wire to my XXXXXXXX XXXX phone App. This information was provided to the banker and he expressed that the wire was processed. He provided documentation of the transfer of which entailed their protocol for wire transfers. We were told the credits would transfer in 24 hours. This never happened. I returned to the bank XXXX days later and was told the funds were being held for security reasons. There was no communication provided to me that an issue presented with the transfer being held by the XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX. So, the retaining of funds were with PNC bank unlawfully. There was no call and no documentation provided to me to support their action ( s ). The manager expressed that she was not aware of the hold and called two other departments for clarity. She was given an email address to contact the person in charge of the hold. Her attempts to reach this person was unsuccessful at the time. She asked if she could contact me later that day with any updates. I received a call about 2 hours later from a PNC representative expressing that she was my case worker assigned to the case. This was even more bizarre. Why would I need a case worker? She never provided me with a case number, call back number, email address or any supporting literature to explain their theft at this point. She led a line of questions that entailed who was the person who provided me with the Cashiers Check, how did I know this person, etc. Her questions to me were without merit nor were they within the guidelines of their policy. This line of questioning was an effort to create a reason for the unlawful hold of credits. She asked me if I knew how this looked? She stated, to open an account, then to come back and close it so soon looked suspicious. How unprofessional and yet another profiling statement. There is no contractual obligation for the account holder to keep an account especially after the unprofessional treatment of the organizations banking representatives. She was already aware that the XXXX XXXXy check had been verified. The credits had been electronically drawn and transferred from the Treasury to PNC bank and they were know doing fractionalized banking using the credits and interest without my knowledge and permission. This presents as unlawful conversion. XXXX hours later I received a call from another person from PNC Bank. At this point I was frustrated with their business acumen. This representative listened as I chronicled the situation. I shared with her that this issue would be reported. As such, it is reported to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX North Carolina XXXX XXXXf Banks, the Comptroller of the Currency, the CFPB, the Office of the Inspector General and the Federal Reserve. She stated that it could again take thirty days to resolve. As of now, the matter is unresolved. Again, I am seeking the immediate release of all credits.

That evening I received a call from XXXX, the Apple Card Goldman Sachs number. I had two recent fraudulent transactions : {$9600.00} on XXXX and {$3600.00} on XXXX both attempted at XXXX XXXX somewhere in Florida. The caller claimed to be a representative from Apple Card services. The caller told me that they could see that I had fraudulent activity on my account. The caller knew the specific amounts of the two fraudulent transactions and where they were from, as well as my last legitimate transaction {$32.00} at XXXX. The caller also knew my address and asked me to confirm it. The caller said he needed to send me a message to my Apple ID with a code to verify my identity so that he could secure my account. \n\nThat is where everything went wrong. \n\nAs soon as I gave the representative the code, I got an alert saying that my password had been changed. I began trying to change the password backand was not as fast as the hacker. \n\nThat code is what gave the hacker access to my apple account -- which allowed him to change the trusted phone number, password, and ultimately the email/Apple ID on the account. Once he took over my account, he then had access to my apple wallet which not only had my Apple Credit Card, but also my XXXX XXXX, and my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Within moments, he had transferred {$500.00}, {$500.00}, {$500.00} out of my account checking account through Apple Cash.\n\nIn the same moment of the first Apple Cash transfer and realizing he was actually a hacker/scammer, I also received a text from my bank asking if the {$500.00} was a fraudulent transaction. The text message allowed me to report the transaction as a fraudulent charge and request a call from the fraud department. Within moments, I spoke with the fraud department and canceled my card. However, the hacker had already succeeded in completing the three charges before I was able to cut off my card. My bank began a fraud investigation with Apple Cash at this time. \n\nNext, I opened my XXXX mobile app to lock my card and request a new number. Thankfully, the hacker had not made any charges on my XXXX card. \n\nAfter that call, I contacted Apple Card Services to place a hold on my account so that the card could not be used while I attempted to sort out the Apple ID credentials and hopefully regain access to my account. It took a few hours to speak to a person from Apple Card Services, so some charges were made during that timebut Apple Card was able to deny them without problem. Once I spoke to someone, a hold was placed on my account and I was told to call back once I got everything sorted out to regain access to my card.\n\nThat evening, I began my first of many conversations with Apple Support trying to recover my account. Each conversation with Apple has been extremely difficult simply because my apple identity no longer is supported by Appleessentially when the hacker took over my account, he erased my identity. ( While there is encrypted data that will always live on in the Apple world with my previous Apple ID, my old Apple ID is no longer supported, and therefore it appears as if it doesnt exist ). Working with the specialist, I submitted tickets to Apple technical support to help with account recovery or activation lock. Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful in gaining access to my original Apple ID, and it was apparent that I was going to have to create a new Apple Identity and then get past the activation lock. Throughout this entire process, each time I spoke with a specialist, they told me they were leaving detailed notes on my account. Each time I spoke with anyone from Apple Card or Apple Support I continued to have to detail the entire ordeal over as if the notes did not exist while new notes were being created. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, as soon as the fraudulent transactions were posted to my bank account and I was able to see the phone number for Apple Cash, I called in to see if I could start a dispute on the charges. At first it was not easy to do because my Apple ID was no longer supported by Apple. Thankfully, because I was the family organizer within our Apple family, using my childs device, I was able to see the email address of the hacker who took over my account -- and was able to provide that email address/Apple ID to the Apple Cash representative. With that information, the representative was able to see all of the transactions. That day, I created a dispute case with Apple Cash representative. She also helped me by blocking the hacker from having access to my children 's accounts. She told me that I should be hearing back from someone within about ten days about the dispute. \n\nFast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter from my bank stating that they have granted me a provisional credit for the {$1500.00} while they continue to investigate the fraud. \n\nThen on XX/XX/XXXX, I got another letter from my bank, with included documents from Apple Cash stating that because all of the charges were done through the wallet using \" XXXX  '' they must have been authorized by user -- and if I felt like I had a legitimate dispute to respond in writing to them. Before I sat down to respond, I called Apple Cash back to check on the status of my dispute, speaking with XXXX, which is when I found out that they had been sending emails and not getting any response. I asked which address the emails had been going to and was told that the emails were being sent to the Apple ID on file. The emails about the dispute were being sent to the hacker himself. Imagine how dumbfounded I was to find out that I had opened a dispute case to get money back that was stolen from me only to find out that the person who stole it from me was receiving emails about the dispute. I was told \" this is just how the system works and you should pray about it. \n\nThe information from Apple Cash stated a few key points which I sent to my bank in my dispute email : This dispute was not from my original dispute, but the banks dispute. \nThe phone number of the account holder ( XXXX ) is not mine ( ending in XXXX ) ( nor my husbands -- ending in XXXX ). Our phone numbers have been the same for well over a decade ( I did change my number when I moved from XXXX, NC to XXXX NC in XXXX -- but I've had the same number since ... My husband has had the same phone number for at least 20 years. ) In the dispute paperwork, it says that for tenure \" most recent card added in the last 7 days of transaction. For device trust is a \" new device with not enough history and information to establish trust in the XXXX XXXX. '' The Phone number trust is a \" new phone number on a device '' with \" insufficient history and information to establish trust in the Apple ecosystem '' How was this not called into question? \nAt the top of the same sheet, it shows that I sent apple cash to my child in XXXX. Considering the previous tenure/new device/new number, how would any of this be possible if I have been using Apple cash with my debit card, Apple ID ( established XXXX XXXX ), and ( this ) phone ( since XX/XX/XXXX )? \nThe Apple Cash was sent to \" XXXX '' which XXXX tells me is a \" prepaid mobile phone. '' I have never sent money to any prepaid mobile phones through any of my apple cash .... And, my carrier is XXXX XXXX XXXX, and have never had a prepaid service. I mainly only send my children money through apple cash, as this is their main way of receiving their allowance. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I went to an Apple Genius Bar where I was able to complete the process of resetting my phone and getting a new Apple IDwhich will finally allow me to start over in the XXXX XXXX \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called Apple Support to update my Apple ID in the system. Then I was switched to Apple Cash where I first found out that the hacker was awarded the dispute, so the money was given back to the hacker -- but thankfully with blocking the account that my first Apple Cash representative did, it locked the hacker from having access to the money. But, I also don't have access to it. Then I was sent to a supervisor who worked very hard to connect a lot of dots to help possibly get the money that I do not have access to awarded to me so that I can pay my bank back. \n\nFinally, I think spoke with Apple Card where I was hopeful to sort out my Apple Card issues. Previously, I had been given the impression that I could transfer the card account to a new ID ( so much so that I have notes about it ), but I found out on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX that my Apple Card could not be transferred to a different account -- that it would always be associated with the previous account. I asked to close the account, and then inquired about how I would receive my bills, as Apple Card users receive their bills within their Apple Wallet app. I was told that the bill would be sent via email. When I asked the representative if the email containing the bill would be coming to my new Apple ID email or if she wanted another email address, she let me know that the bills would be going to the Apple ID email on the account associated with the Apple Card. Meaning that the hacker will get a monthly email from Goldman Sachs Apple Card with my personal information. I challenged, and begged the representative to change this and not allow this to happen and was told \" there is nothing we can do '' and \" I can put a note in your account. '' I told the representative that I had very little faith in the notes that were left on my account. I asked to escalate to a supervisor above her and was told there was no one who could do anything to prevent the hacker from getting my personal information -- or for me to get a bill without calling in, verifying my identity, and requesting one each month.\n\nI am very concerned about the fact that the hacker already had so much access to my personal information from the security breach that took place when he hacked my Apple ID, but finding out that he got more personal information during the Apple Cash dispute, and that he will continue to get my personal information monthly for the foreseeable from Apple Card until the outstanding balance is satisfied is alarming and should be easily preventable. \n\n-- - In addition to all of this, I have also created a police report, a report with my attorney general, a report with the FBI, and the FTC.", "date_sent_to_company": "2023-11-06T12:00:00-05:00", "issue": "Unauthorized transactions or other transaction problem", "sub_product": "Mobile or digital wallet", "zip_code": "27103", "tags": null, "complaint_id": "7804794", "timely": "Yes", "consumer_consent_provided": "Consent provided", "company_response": "Closed with explanation", "submitted_via": "Web", "company": "GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA", "date_received": "2023-11-06T12:00:00-05:00", "state": "NC", "consumer_disputed": "N/A", "company_public_response": null, "sub_issue": null}, "sort": [1107888]},{"_index": "complaint-public-v1", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "6588920", "_score": null, "_source": {"product": "Checking or savings account", "complaint_what_happened": "I am XXXX XXXX and Bank of America withdrew {$1400.00} from my checking account my mother opened up for me at XXXX.

This was contradictory to what I was told before. I visited the bank again to enquire about this matter. After spending almost 3 hours at the bank while branch staff made numerous calls, I was told that the account would be closed and I would receive a check for US {$6000.00}, which was the balance of my account. I agreed to this resolution and confirmed with the branch staff the amount that I would receive and the expected delivery date of the check. \n\nThen, two weeks later, I received a check for only US {$85.00}, and BOA sent a letter notifying me that they would not return theUS {$6000.00} to me. They said they had frozen the funds. I had to visit the bank again to enquire about this matter. After spending another several hours at the bank while branch staff made numerous calls, I was told that BOA had already returned the funds back to my wife 's account with XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX and that BOA was no longer in possession of the money.
