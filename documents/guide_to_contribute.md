##  Steps to Contribute to the Project

### 1. Clone or Rebase
- Clone the main branch of the repository to a project folder on your local drive. This creates a local copy of the project.
- If you already have the repository cloned, rebase your local branch to ensure it is up to date with the main branch.

### 2. Create a New Branch
- From your local clone of the main branch, create a new branch for your changes.
- Use a separate branch for each contribution, naming it in **snake_case** format with short, meaningful descriptions of the change (e.g., `add_feature_x`).

### 3. Make Changes
- Make the necessary changes to the new branch locally.
- Run any local tests regularly to identify and fix issues early.

### 4. Publish Branch and Push Changes
- Save and commit your changes locally.
- Publish your new branch to the shared repository and push the committed changes.

### 5. Address CI Checks
- If the branch fails automated continuous integration (CI) checks, make corrections until the checks pass.
- You can push changes to your branch multiple times as needed to meet the requirements.

### 6. Create a Pull Request (PR)
- Open a pull request from your new branch to merge the changes into the main branch.
- Ensure that your branch passes all CI checks before initiating a PR. If merging despite failing checks is necessary, provide a clear explanation.

### 7. Review and Merge
- Prompt another team member to review your changes.
- Once the changes are approved, the reviewer will merge the branch into the main branch and delete the temporary branch.

### 8. Cleanup
- Delete the merged branches from both the shared remote repository and your local repository.
- Rebase or pull the latest main branch to ensure your local repository reflects the latest updates.

## Key Terms

### `.gitignore`
Specifies files and folders to exclude from version control (e.g., temporary files, logs).

### `.env` and Similar Files
Contains sensitive data like API keys or configuration variables. These files should **never** be published to GitHub.

### Continuous Integration (CI)
Practices for safe and efficient development by integrating small, frequent changes. CI emphasizes automated testing for:
- **General Tests**: Catch common issues like coding style or security vulnerabilities.
- **Project-Specific Tests**: Ensure the functionality meets project requirements.

### Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD)
Aims to streamline development with automated code integration and deployment pipelines. Continuous integration (CI) ensures small changes are integrated frequently and safely, while continuous delivery (CD) automates releasing those changes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Guidelines for CI/CD
- Use automated pipelines to test and deploy code changes rapidly and reliably.
- Ensure each feature or fix is tested individually in isolation before merging into the main branch.
